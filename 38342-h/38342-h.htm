<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>According to discoveries made by Titus Oates in the autumn
of 1678, England was threatened by a Roman Catholic conspiracy
headed by the Pope and the King of France, whose objectives
were: 1) to murder the King, 2) to overthrow the government, and
3) to destroy the Protestant religion. Although Oates was subsequently
exposed as a charlatan, in 1678-81 a panic held the
nation in an iron grip, and belief in the Plot fostered irrational
and reprehensible excesses. The Popish Plot was not so much
a religious fraud as a political <i>cause célèbre</i>, the significance of
which can be assessed only in the context of the republican movement
of the seventeenth century to redistribute power within the
state. The conflict which developed between Charles II and the
Parliament during the 1670's reflects the struggle for ascendance
of two opposing theories of government: absolute versus limited
monarchy. Charles, supported by the Tories and the Anglican
clergy, was determined to maintain all the hereditary privileges
and powers of an English monarch, while the Whig coalition in
Parliament, led by the Earl of Shaftesbury, was intent upon subordinating
the power of the Crown to the will of Parliament. The
Opposition realized almost immediately that in the Popish Plot
lay means for furthering their schemes of political reform. Under
the guise of counteracting the Plot, they hoped to enact legislation
to: 1) increase parliamentary power, 2) limit the prerogatives
of the King, 3) control the succession, and 4) curtail the influence
of the prelacy. Published in 1680 when the Plot crisis was at
its peak, <i>Citt and Bumpkin</i> is one of a series of pamphlets by Sir
Roger L'Estrange written to support the policies of Charles II and
to defend the government from attacks by the Whig Opposition.</p>

<p>Since James, Duke of York, had given the Whigs every reason
to believe that he would oppose their policies vehemently after he
came to the throne, they decided to take advantage of the public
resentment against him as a Roman Catholic to try to pass a bill
in Parliament to exclude him from the succession. James had
already been accused of conspiring with the French King to overthrow
Protestantism in England and institute Roman Catholicism
as the state religion. In addition to reiterating this charge, the<span class="pagenum">[Pg ii]</span>
Whigs enlarged upon the awkwardness and danger bound to arise
in a Protestant nation with a Roman Catholic ruler. The question
of a Popish successor soon came to be the principal concern of
Parliament, and the battle over the Exclusion Bill dominated the
political scene in 1679-81. While the Exclusion crisis was at
its height, Charles II circumvented this plan to deprive the Duke
of York of his hereditary title by repeatedly proroguing and dissolving
Parliament so that the bill could not be brought to a final
vote. This series of adjournments began when Charles dissolved
the Parliament soon after the Exclusion Bill was first introduced
in the spring of 1679. After a bitterly fought election contest
during the summer of 1679, the newly constituted Parliament assembled
in October only to be prorogued once again until 26 January
1680. The Whigs were furious and began to fear that the
King had no intention of permitting the Parliament to meet even
in January. Powerless to act legally out of Parliament, the Whigs
realized that a long series of postponements would lead to the
defeat of all their carefully drafted legislative plans. To combat
Charles' delaying tactics, the Opposition hit upon the expedient
of petitioning him to allow Parliament to sit. By a strong demonstration
of popular will, they hoped to force the King to comply
with their demands.</p>

<p>Under the leadership of Shaftesbury and his followers in the
Green Ribbon Club, the Whigs achieved a degree of party organization
and efficiency in the autumn and winter of 1679-80 which remained
unrivalled during the seventeenth century.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> While petitions
were being printed in London, the country was divided into districts;
then petitions were distributed to party agents everywhere
who systematically canvassed for signatures. In London, blank
petitions were conveniently placed in coffee houses and taverns;
pens and inkstands appeared in the Strand and at the Royal Exchange.
Since these petitions were designed as instruments to
convey the will of the masses, emphasis was placed on collecting
large numbers of signatures with scant concern for the political,
economic, or social status of the subscribers. According to the
Tory historian Roger North, the people were warned by the promoters
of the petitions that, if the King were allowed to govern
without a Parliament, despotism would inevitably ensue, followed<span class="pagenum">[Pg iii]</span>
by a resurgence of Popery.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Frightened, and in some cases
confused by these formidable predictions and threats, many people
(especially in the country) subscribed. After the canvassing had
been completed, the petitions were sent to London for presentation
to the King.</p>

<p>The petitions themselves were phrased inoffensively enough,
stressing the fact that the Popish Plot had created a state of
national emergency and requesting that Parliament be called to
deal with this danger. The first petition, <i>The Humble Address
and Advice of several of the Peeres of this Realm For the Sitting
of the Parliament</i>, was presented to the King at Whitehall on 7
December by ten Whig peers. Charles accepted the petition and
dismissed them. But he could not dismiss the rumors of countless
other petitions in preparation and the unavoidable disturbance
such an onslaught would produce. Since the petitions were not
promoted through official channels, and since there was evidence
that they were designed to create tumult for seditious ends,
Charles denounced them as illegal. Moreover, on 11 December
the King issued a Royal Proclamation forbidding seditious and
tumultuous petitioning. The effects of the Proclamation were
twofold. The Tories, who objected to petitioning as a popular
movement carried on by men without substance or position, received
the Proclamation everywhere as an expression of the
King's disapproval, and cited it as an authority to discourage
others from promoting and subscribing to petitions. The Whigs,
on the other hand, protested that petitioning was the legal right
of the subject and resumed their petitioning activities with added
vigor.</p>

<p>In order to demonstrate his firm resolve not to be intimidated
in the exercise of his prerogative to call and dismiss Parliament,
and in order to rob the petitioning movement of its impetus by
destroying its immediate objective, Charles issued a second
Proclamation on 11 December proroguing Parliament from 26 January
to 11 November 1680. Spurred on by the realization that so
long a recess would utterly ruin their hopes, the Whigs directed
considerable effort toward promoting an official petition from the
City of London.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Because of the power and prestige of the City,
the Whigs felt that such a petition would lend encouragement to<span class="pagenum">[Pg iv]</span>
those being prepared in the country. Accordingly, they arranged
to present a petition from the City of London for a vote in the
Common Council on 20 January. The King deliberately attempted
to frustrate the London petition by purging the City Council of
disaffected members through enforcement of the Act for Regulating
Corporations. This Act disqualified all Dissenters, who
usually held Whig principles. Consequently, by the time the petition
was brought to a vote, the Tories had gained enough support
to defeat the referendum by a small margin. Although this ballot
was won in effect only by the votes of the Court of Aldermen, it
was accounted a great victory for the Court Party and left the
Whigs sorely disappointed.</p>

<p>The peak of petitioning activity occurred during the month of
January, and the atmosphere became increasingly more tense as
the day approached upon which Parliament was supposed to meet.
The week following the Common Council's rejection of the London
petition was the most strained. Petitions continued to appear
daily, though the King received them with marked disfavor and
sharply rebuked the delegates who delivered them. When Monday,
26 January, finally arrived, the air was charged with excitement;
everyone crowded to Westminster to see what would happen. But
Charles had no intention of capitulating. As soon as the Lords
and Commons were assembled, the King addressed them, reaffirming
his determination to prorogue them and implying that the recent
petitions had served only to strengthen his resolve. The Whigs
complained bitterly but offered no open resistance. Charles had
won the day and emerged with his prerogative untarnished but not
unchallenged. Shortly after this <i>coup</i>, a counter reaction to petitioning
set in, and a wave of loyalty gained momentum and found
expression in the form of abhorrence addresses which poured in
from all over the kingdom condemning the practice of petitioning
and professing loyalty to King and Court.</p>

<p>A fortnight after the prorogation of Parliament, just before
the tide of abhorrence addresses began to inundate the capital,
on 10 February, Narcissus Luttrell (indefatigable collector of
Popish Plot ephemera) recorded possession of the most important
pamphlet written about petitioning&mdash;Sir Roger L'Estrange's <i>Citt
and Bumpkin</i>. Whether the date which Luttrell gives represents<span class="pagenum">[Pg v]</span>
the day of publication as well as the day of purchase is a matter
of conjecture, but his note does establish the fact that the pamphlet
was available to the public and in Luttrell's hands by 10
February. Corroboration that the pamphlet was in circulation
before the end of February comes also from L'Estrange's bookseller
Henry Brome, who first advertised <i>Citt and Bumpkin</i> for
sale as already published in a list of pamphlets dated 27 February.
On 5 March in the <i>Popish Courant</i>, a companion sheet to <i>The
Weekly Pacquet of Advice from Rome</i>, a violently anti-Papist
newspaper in which L'Estrange was frequently traduced, Henry
Care condemned <i>Citt and Bumpkin</i> in a list of Catholic libels,
"All publisht within little more than this fortnight." Although less
precise than Luttrell's note, the references by Brome and Care
help confirm the hypothesis that <i>Citt and Bumpkin</i> was published
by mid-February. Further evidence which helps to define the date
of publication occurs within the text of the pamphlet itself. On
page 24, L'Estrange mentions Henry Care's <i>History of the Damnable
Popish Plot</i> and says it appeared on 26 January. This date
in turn is verified by two advertisements for the work in Care's
own journal&mdash;one on 23 January announcing its impending release,
and another on 30 January commenting on its recent publication.
Since <i>Citt and Bumpkin</i> obviously appeared after Care's tract was
released and before Luttrell's entry was made, it must have been
published during the fortnight between 26 January and 10 February.</p>

<p><i>Citt and Bumpkin</i> was not only the best written pamphlet on
petitioning, it was also the most ambitious in scope. Arranging
his material artfully, L'Estrange presented it with the wit and skill
that demonstrate unequivocably his mastery of the polemic medium.
Unlike most other party writers who confined their efforts to a
few folio pages, L'Estrange sustained his performance through
38 quarto leaves of readable, entertaining prose. Moreover, his
objectives and arguments were much more comprehensive and
sophisticated than those of the other pamphleteers engaged in the
controversy over petitioning. Most Tory writers treated petitioning
as an isolated issue and directed their attack accordingly, failing
to relate any of their arguments to each other or to a larger scheme.
Many authors attempted to defeat petitioning by identifying the
petitions of 1680 with those of the 1640's leading up to the Civil<span class="pagenum">[Pg vi]</span>
War. In addition, some insisted that petitioning was illegal and
defended the Proclamation against it, while others tried to discredit
the organizers and promoters of petitions as disaffected
persons motivated by hopes of preferment and profit. At the same
time, they launched a collateral attack upon those members of
Parliament who actively encouraged petitioning. There was even
a general indictment of Parliament as a whole, suggesting that it
intended to usurp the King's prerogatives and take sovereignty upon
itself. But there was no definite, direct statement that a plot led
by the petition managers was actually underway to subvert the
government. In <i>Citt and Bumpkin</i> L'Estrange accused the republicans
and Dissenters of actively promoting a Protestant Plot more
insidious than the Popish Plot but with identical goals: 1) to kill
the King, 2) to undermine the government, and 3) to destroy the
established Church of England. Throughout the pamphlet, which
is an <i>exposé</i> of this alleged conspiracy, L'Estrange supplied a
great deal of specific factual detail upholding his claims. His
objective was not merely to discredit petitioning, but to lessen
belief in the Popish Plot and to launch a counterattack against the
enemies of the Court. By indicating that petitioning was not an
end in itself but an integral part of a larger plan, L'Estrange managed
to censure petitioning <i>per se</i>, to increase its odium by linking
it with the greater disaster of rebellion and civil war, and yet to
preserve a sense of proportion by directing the brunt of his attack
against the Protestant Plot as a whole.</p>

<p>Although it is cast in the form of an ironic dialogue, <i>Citt and
Bumpkin</i> has much in common with a dramatic skit. L'Estrange
sketches the setting, develops the characterization, provides realistic
conversation, and builds dramatic tension to a climax (or turning
point in the action), which is followed by a falling off of tension
or <i>dénouement</i>. As if to make the reading of parts easier, the
speeches of the characters are set in different type faces. L'Estrange
even provides stage directions and indicates action in the
speeches of the characters. Like many dramas, <i>Citt and Bumpkin</i>
begins <i>in medias res</i> and draws the reader immediately into the
action. In a very natural fashion, the subject of the conversation
is defined and the scene is set within the first four lines. The
sense of setting is never destroyed, for L'Estrange unobtrusively<span class="pagenum">[Pg vii]</span>
sustains it by occasional specific but natural references to it in
the course of the conversation.</p>

<p>The dialogue between Citt and Bumpkin takes place during
a casual encounter in a tavern, where the two fall to discussing
religion and politics over a cup of ale. As their names suggest,
Citt and Bumpkin represent a sophisticated London citizen and a
naive country bumpkin. While they are not fully realized dramatic
characters, neither are they mere bloodless stick figures. During
the course of their conversation, they reveal information about
their personalities, their social and economic status, their political
affiliations, their religious sympathies, their moral values,
and their occupations. One learns from Citt that he is an ex-felon
who is employed as a party agent by a political organization
plotting to overthrow the government and undermine the Church
of England. Motivated only by ambition and avarice, Citt is a
completely immoral man who openly endorses a policy of expediency,
and who condones any act&mdash;no matter how evil&mdash;because he
believes that the end always justifies the means. As befits a
partner in crime, Bumpkin is Citt's <i>Doppelgänger</i> in many ways.
The essential differences are those of experience and intelligence.
Bumpkin is only slightly less immoral and unscrupulous than Citt,
but he is just as hypocritical, lawless, and untruthful. As the two
discuss how they promoted petitions in the city and the country,
Citt and Bumpkin admit to all sorts of treacherous and Fraudulent
practices. In addition, they reveal the goals, the methods, the
leaders, the strength, and the immorality of the Protestant Plot.
Ironically, they unintentionally expose themselves and the Plot
to the reader's censure; for, although the characters seem to be
oblivious to the immorality of their behavior, the reader is not so
insensitive. The reader contrasts their ethics and conduct with
ideal values, rejects their code as immoral, and carries his judgment
of the characters over into the real world to condemn the
petitioners as republican plotters.</p>

<p>To reinforce this ironic self-indictment by Citt and Bumpkin,
L'Estrange introduces a third character, Trueman, who enters
like a <i>deus ex machina</i> to represent the abstract forces of truth,
justice, and morality&mdash;albeit with a Tory bias. Because he functions
as an abstract symbol in contrast with Citt and Bumpkin, who<span class="pagenum">[Pg viii]</span>
are very much of this world, Trueman has a personality uncomplicated
by any psychological subtleties or idiosyncrasies which
would emphasize his humanity. The entrance of Trueman may well
be regarded as the climax of this little drama, for the plot unfolds
gradually and dramatic tension builds to the point of his intrusion,
when the course of action is interrupted and diverted in another direction
by his arguments. Taking up the topics previously discussed
by Citt and Bumpkin while he was concealed in a nearby closet,
Trueman confronts them with their confessed treachery, denounces
their chicanery and folly, and refutes their political views with
Tory arguments. The fact that Trueman symbolizes extrahuman
moral forces lends authority to his defense of absolute monarchy
and the established Church.</p>

<p>Couched in an authentic colloquial style, the dialogue between
Citt and Bumpkin progresses in an entirely natural, credible manner.
Their conversation is animated, colorful, humorous, informative, and
purposeful. The direction of the conversation is logically dictated
by its substance; there is nothing artificial, contrived, or foreordained
about it. The interaction of personality is reflected in the
verbal exchange. As in a play, the development of the action depends
upon each character's immediate and genuine response to
the statements made by the other <i>dramatis personae</i>. Again, as in
the theater, dramatic tension is created as the plot unfolds and
the reader waits to see what will happen next. Except for one
passage of extended quotation (pp. 32-33), the dramatic realism is
sustained effortlessly.</p>

<p>Although <i>Citt and Bumpkin</i> was the first of L'Estrange's
Popish Plot pamphlets written in dialogue, he was thoroughly
familiar with the form and had often employed it in his polemic
skirmishes during the Civil War. In fact, L'Estrange found the
genre so congenial that he chose to write his famous newspaper
<i>The Observator</i> (1681-87) in dialogue. This literary device, employed
by hack writers, controversialists, and eminent <i>littérateurs</i>,
was extremely popular in England between 1660 and 1700 and was
used to conspicuous advantage for discussing issues of momentary
importance as well as serious philosophical questions. According
to Eugene R. Purpus in his study of the "Dialogue in English Literature,
1660-1725," few other literary forms had such universal<span class="pagenum">[Pg ix]</span>
and continual appeal.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In an age when the drama was the reigning
literary fashion, the dialogue naturally enough had a concomitant
vogue. Its popularity is attested to by the large number of dialoguists
as well as by the bulk of their writing. As Purpus notes,
party writers quickly discovered that this genre was an excellent
vehicle for presenting highly controversial ideas and forceful arguments.</p>

<p>During the Restoration, there were no rigid conventions governing
the genre, and any work passed as a dialogue which represented
a conversation between two or more persons or which
was organized in a question-and-answer manner.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Frequently,
dialogues resembled an interrogation or a catechism rather than
natural discourse between real human beings. Often writers of
such artificial dialogues abandoned any attempt at characterization
or conversational verisimilitude, merely substituting "Q."
and "A." to indicate a series of queries and responses. Sometimes
authors identified the speakers with proper names but made
no effort at actual characterization. Concern for dramatic realism
varied from writer to writer; and all too often, improbable puppet-like
creatures were represented in illogical, unbelievable, and contrived
conversations. The artistic integrity of a successful dialogue,
however, lies in the dramatic exchange of differing points
of view or the interplay of opposing arguments in realistic conversation
between credible characters with clearly differentiated
personalities.</p>

<p>The stilted, artificial quality of some dialogues is in part
attributable to the fact that many writers turned to the genre as a
facile means of expressing a particular point of view.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> As Purpus
observes, the inherent dramatic quality of the form is lost if:
1) the writer substitutes invective, prejudice, and railing for
realistic conversation, and/or 2) the author obviously contrives
the dialogue merely to reflect his particular bias on a given question.
On the other hand, although some writers used the form as
a convenient frame on which to display their opinions, other
writers erred by including too much dramatic machinery. Dialogues
of this sort almost became short dramas.</p>

<p>No matter what the content or objective purpose of dialogues,
however, they were uniformly written in what became known after<span class="pagenum">[Pg x]</span>
the Restoration as the "plain, easy, and familiar" style.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Sentences
were more conveniently broken up than heretofore, and
there was increased lightness of tone. Though there was still
a great deal of invective, Hugh Macdonald notes in "Banter in
English Controversial Prose after the Restoration," that banter
became prominent in the literature of disputation after 1660. On
the other hand, "No one would expect to find a clear-cut division
between banter, satire, sarcasm, burlesque, and abuse in every
passage of a book written in the seventeenth century."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> As Mr.
Macdonald states, it is largely a question of emphasis. Employing
a great deal of banter, Marvell reintroduced a tradition forgotten
since the Marprelate tracts&mdash;that of treating a grave subject lightly
yet with serious intention of reinforcing the argument. Restoration
polemicists, with L'Estrange in the vanguard, quickly realized the
advantages of this technique and claimed it as their own.</p>

<p><i>Citt and Bumpkin</i> survives close scrutiny according to the
critical criteria for evaluating dialogues suggested by Purpus and
Macdonald. Although L'Estrange does use the genre for a specific
controversial end, he does not lapse into a barren question-and-answer
type of organization nor into that of an artificial didactic
catechism. While he sketches a setting, develops characterization,
and creates believable conversation, L'Estrange does not
err in the direction of over-dramatization either. He provides all
the requisite machinery to support the dramatic realism necessary
in a successful dialogue, but he goes no further. Throughout <i>Citt
and Bumpkin</i>, L'Estrange maintains the appropriate "plain, easy
and familiar" style. The sentence structure is simple, and clauses
are well punctuated. Abounding with colloquial expressions, contractions,
and slang, the vocabulary is common and especially
suited to the low characters. A bantering tone predominates, accompanied
by passages employing irony, satire, and invective.
There is not enough invective, however, to destroy the mood. If
L'Estrange's Tory bias is perfectly evident, it is not aggressive
enough to prevent the accomplishment of his polemic objectives.
Although the republican political theories of the Whigs are attacked
satirically in the first part of <i>Citt and Bumpkin</i>, they are stated
and refuted in proper controversial style in the final pages of the
pamphlet. On the whole, <i>Citt and Bumpkin</i> conforms to the<span class="pagenum">[Pg xi]</span>
conventions of a successful dialogue; where it does not, the
infringements are not great enough to destroy its artistic integrity.</p>

<p><i>Citt and Bumpkin's</i> popularity was indisputable. Of all the
pamphlets about petitioning, it was by far the most widely read.
It went into four editions by June 1680 and a fifth in 1681. Although
there were no substantive changes in the various editions,
the type was reset each time, so implying a continuing demand for
the pamphlet. Indeed, the contemporary response was so overwhelming
that within six weeks L'Estrange wrote a sequel entitled,
<i>Citt and Bumpkin, The Second Part; Or, A Learned Discourse
upon Swearing and Lying</i>. In addition, there were many
references in the Whig press denigrating L'Estrange and his pamphlet;
derogatory remarks appeared in newspapers, ballads, and
poems. In particular, three pamphlets were issued, replying directly
to <i>Citt and Bumpkin</i> and attacking L'Estrange personally.
The first and most considerable of these rejoinders appeared on
16 March, a month after the publication of <i>Citt and Bumpkin</i>, when
its effect was being fully realized and the need felt to combat it.</p>

<p><i>A Dialogue Between Tom and Dick Over a Dish of Coffee
Concerning Matters of Religion and Government</i>, issued also as
<i>Crack-fart and Tony; Or, Knave and Fool</i>,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> is a parody following
closely the format and arguments of <i>Citt and Bumpkin</i>. Having
appropriated the framework employed by L'Estrange, the author
of <i>Tom and Dick</i> adjusted it by a series of simple substitutions
from an attack on the Protestant Plot, Dissenters, Schism, and
republicans, to an assault on the Popish Plot, Papists, Roman
Catholicism, and loyalists. The parallels in setting and characterization
are established immediately, when Tom and Dick meet
in a coffee house and agree to hold a conversation in which Tom
will speak, write, invent, and hold forth as Citt had done, while
Dick will hear, believe, and speak in his turn (but to little purpose)
like Bumpkin. The parody breaks down, however, when one
compares Trueman with Goodman, who endorses Trueman's arguments
rather than misrepresenting or opposing them. Nor does
Goodman observe Trueman's scrupulous care in replying to all
the issues raised by the other two characters. Throughout the
dialogue, the author manages to maintain dramatic realism and to
sustain a mock-serious tone in the absurd-but-credible verbal
exchange between his two buffoons.<span class="pagenum">[Pg xii]</span></p>

<p>The second rebuttal was released three months later on 14
June. Signed E. P. (possibly Edward Phillips), <i>The Dialogue
Betwixt Cit and Bumpkin Answered</i> replies not only to <i>Citt and
Bumpkin</i>, but reflects upon several other polemic tracts by
L'Estrange, and attacks him <i>ad hominem</i> from beginning to end.
A long prefatory letter discussing the powers and privileges of
city corporations and the faults of L'Estrange's <i>Popery in Masquerade</i>
precedes the dialogue, which preserves the same general
format and style of its target. The roles of the characters are
only roughly analogous, however, and the development of the
argument is retarded and obscured by the abuse of L'Estrange.
All too often, the argument is neither pertinent nor incisive. Unfortunately,
E. P. lacks all the vitality, wit, and imagination of
his polemic adversary. Incensed by E. P.'s scurrility, L'Estrange
replied within three days to all of his charges in <i>A Short Answer
to a Whole Litter of Libels</i>.</p>

<p>Although it does not appear in Luttrell's <i>Popish Plot Catalogues</i>,
the third reply to <i>Citt and Bumpkin</i>, <i>Crack upon Crack: Or,
Crack-Fart Whipt with his own Rod, by Citt and Bumpkin</i>, can be
dated approximately upon the basis of internal evidence. References
to L'Estrange's flight to escape a sham plot against him in
October, 1680, imply a late autumn publication date. Purporting
to answer both parts of <i>Citt and Bumpkin</i>, this pamphlet does not
deal with any of the arguments raised in either work. The author
abandons any attempt at parody, and instead borrows details of
setting from the popular <i>Letter from Legorn</i> pamphlets which appeared
that year. The characters pursue the absconded Trueman
(<i>i.e.</i>, L'Estrange) aboard a Mahometan (<i>i.e.</i>, Papist) ship and lure
him ashore in order to seek revenge for their recent humiliation at
his hands. The dialogue contains four pages of unimaginative
abuse of Trueman which culminates in his drubbing by Citt and
Bumpkin. Largely scatological, this uninspired attack upon L'Estrange
does not strike a single telling blow against <i>Citt and Bumpkin</i>.</p>

<p>In fact, <i>Citt and Bumpkin</i> enjoyed unqualified success despite the
best efforts of its various detractors. And its popularity was well
deserved. Appearing just when the unrest over petitioning was
at its height, <i>Citt and Bumpkin</i> captured the interest and imagination
of the public with its cogent argument and witty satire.<span class="pagenum">[Pg xiii]</span></p>

<h2><i>Citt</i> and <i>Bumkin</i>,</h2>

<h3>In a DIALOGUE, <i>&amp;c.</i></h3>


<p><i>Citt.</i> So that you would know, <i>First</i>, how we <i>manag'd</i> the
<i>Petition</i>; and <i>Secondly</i>, how it came to <i>miscarry</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Those are the two Points</i>, Citt, <i>but first take
off your</i> Pot, <i>and then tell your</i> Story; <i>you shall have
mine afterward</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Committees
to promote
the Petitions.</div>

<p><i>Citt.</i> There was no way, you must know, to carry the business
clear, without getting a <i>Vote</i> of <i>Common-Council</i> for the <i>Petition</i>;
and so making it an Act of the <i>City</i>: And in order to
this End, we planted our <i>Committees</i> every where up and down,
from <i>Algate</i> to <i>Temple-barr</i>, at convenient distances; some few
of them in <i>Taverns</i> but most at <i>Coffee-houses</i>; as less liable to
suspition. Now we did not call these <i>Meetings</i>, <i>Committees</i>, but
<i>Clubs</i>; and <i>there</i> we had all Freedom both for <i>Privacy</i> and <i>Debate</i>:
while the <i>Borough</i> of <i>Southwark</i>, <i>Westminster</i>, and the <i>Suburbs</i>,
proceeded according to our Method.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>And what were these</i> Committees <i>now to do</i>?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their Powers
and Instructions.</div>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Their <i>Commission</i> was to procure <i>Subscriptions</i>, to justify
the Right of <i>Petitioning</i>, and to gain <i>Intelligence</i>: And then every
<i>Committee</i> had one man at least in it that wrote <i>short-hand</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Well, and what was he to do?</i></p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> It was his part to go smoking up and down from One
Company to another, to see who was <i>for</i> us, and who <i>against</i>
us: and to take Notes of what people said of the <i>Plot</i>, or of the
<i>Kings Witnesses</i>, or against <a name="this" id="this"></a><a href="#his">this</a> way of <i>Petitioning</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>But how came those Committees (as ye call 'um) by their</i>
Commissions?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Two Grand
Committees.</div>

<p><i>Citt.</i> For that, let me tell you, we had <i>two Grand Committees</i>,
that adjourn'd from place to place, as they saw occasion: But
they met most commonly at <i>Two Coffee-houses</i>; the <i>One</i> near
<i>Guild-Hall</i>, the <i>Other</i> in the <i>Strand</i>; for you must take notice
that we went on, hand in hand with our <i>Neighbours</i> in the <i>Main
Design</i>.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 2]</span></p>

<p>Bum. <i>But you do not tell me yet who set up the</i> Other Committees.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Office of
the Grand
Committees.</div>

<p><i>Citt.</i> These two <i>Grand Committees</i>, I tell you, nominated
and appointed the <i>Sub-Committees</i>, gave them their <i>Orders</i>, and
received their <i>Reports</i>: It was their Office moreover to digest
<i>Discoveries</i>, and <i>Informations</i>; to instruct <i>Articles</i>, improve
<i>Accusations</i>, manage <i>Controversies</i>, defray the charge of <i>Intelligencers</i>,
and <i>Gatherers of hands</i>, to dispose of <i>Collections</i>; to influence
the <i>Anglicus</i>'s and <i>Domesticks</i>, and fortify those that
were weak in the Faith; to furnish matter sometimes for <i>Narratives</i>.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Bum. <i>What dost thou mean by</i> Narratives, Citt?</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> They are only <i>Strange Storys</i>; as that of the <i>Dragon</i>
in <i>Essex</i>; <i>Earth-quakes</i>, <i>Sights in the Air</i>, <i>Prodigies</i>, and the like.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>One would think it should not be worth their while, to busy
their heads about such Fooleries as these.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Stories of
Prodigies
startle the
Common
People.</div>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Now this is thy simplicity <i>Bumpkin</i>, for there is not
any thing that moves the hearts of the People so effectually toward
<i>the Work of the Lord</i>, especially when the <i>Narrative</i> carries
some <i>Historical Remarque</i> in the Tayl of it: As for the purpose,
<i>this or that happen'd in such a Kings Reign, and soon after such and
such troubles befell the Church and State</i>: such a <i>Civil War</i>, such or
such a <i>Persecution</i>, or <i>Invasion</i> follow'd upon it. When the People
perceive once that the Lord hath declared himself against
the Nation, in these tokens of his Displeasure, the Multitude
seldom fail of helping the Judgment forward.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>I don't know what ye call your</i> Committees, <i>but Our Gentry
had their</i> Meetings <i>too; and there was a great Lord or two among
'um that shall be Nameless</i>.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> We could shew you <i>othergates Lords</i> among <i>Us</i>, I'le assure
you, then any you have; but let that passe.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>You told me that your</i> Committees <i>were to procure</i> Subscriptions;
<i>we were hard put to't, I'm sure, in the</i> Country <i>to get</i>
Hands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The way of
getting hands
in and about
<i>London</i>.</div>

<p><i>Citt.</i> And so were we in the City <i>Bumpkin</i>; and if it had not
been to advance the <i>Protestant Interest</i>, I'de have been torn to
pieces by wild Horses, before I'de have done what I did. But
<i>extraordinary Cases</i> must have <i>extraordinary allowances</i>. There
was hardly a <i>Register</i> about the Town that scap'd us for <i>Names</i>:
<i>Bedlam</i>, <i>Bridewell</i>, all the <i>Parish-books</i>, nay the very <i>Goals</i>, and<span class="pagenum">[Pg 3]</span>
<i>Hospitalls</i>; we had our <i>Agents</i> at all <i>Publick Meetings</i>, <i>Court</i>,
<i>Church</i>, <i>Change</i>, all the <i>Schools</i> up and down; <i>Masters</i> underwrit
for their <i>Children</i>, and <i>Servants</i>, <i>Women</i> for their <i>Husbands</i>
in the <i>West-Indies</i>, nay we prevail'd upon some <i>Parsons</i>, to engage
for their whole <i>Congregations</i>; we took in <i>Jack Straw</i>, <i>Wat
Tyler</i>, and the whole Legend of <i>Poor Robins Saints</i> into our List
of <i>Petitioners</i>; and the <i>same Names</i> serv'd us in four or five <i>several
places</i>. And where's the hurt of all this now? So long as the
Cause it self is Righteous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Several ways
of getting
Hands in the
Country.</div>

<p>Bum. <i>Nay, the thing was well enough</i> Citt, <i>if we could but have
gone through with it: And you shall see now that we were put to our
shifts in the</i> Country, <i>as well as you in the</i> City. <i>I was employ'd you
must know, to get</i> Names <i>at</i> four shillings a Hundred, <i>and I had
all my</i> Real Subscriptions <i>written at such a distance, one from another,
that I could easily clap in a Name or two betwixt 'um; and then
I got as many</i> School-boys <i>as I could, to underwrite after the same
manner, and after this, fill'd up all those spaces with</i> Names <i>that I
either</i> Remember'd, <i>or</i> Invented <i>my self, or could get out of two or
three</i> Christning-books. <i>There are a World (ye know) of</i> Smiths,
Browns, Clarks, Walkers, Woods, <i>so that I furnish'd my Catalogue
with a matter of Fifty a piece of these</i> Sir-names<i>, which I</i> Christen'd
<i>my self. And besides, we had all the</i> Non-conformist Ministers
<i>in the</i> Country <i>for us, and they brought in a power of hands</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Protestant
Dissenters
great
Promoters of
the Petition.</div>

<p><i>Citt.</i> What do you talk of <i>your Non-conformists</i>? They do but
work <i>Journey-work</i> to <i>Ours</i>. We have the <i>Heads</i> of all the <i>Protestant
Dissenters</i> in the <i>Nation</i> here in this Town, why, we have
more <a name="Religions" id="Religions"></a><i><a href="#Religion">Religions</a></i>, <i>Bumpkin</i>, in <i>this City</i>, then you have <i>People</i> in your
whole <i>Country</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Ay, and 'tis a great blessing too, that when</i> Professors <i>are
at so mighty Variance among</i> themselves<i>, there should be so wonderfull
an</i> Agreement <i>in the</i> Common Cause.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> And that's notably observ'd, <i>Bumkin</i>; for so we found
it here. The <i>Presbyterian</i> got hands of <i>His Party</i>; the <i>Independent</i>
of <i>His</i>; the <i>Baptist</i> of <i>His</i>; the <i>Fifth-Monarchy</i> man of <i>His</i>;
and so throughout all our Divisions: and we had still the most
zealous man in His way, to gather the <i>Subscriptions</i>: And when
they had completed their <i>Roll</i>, they discharg'd themselves as
Naturally into the <i>Grand Committee</i>, as <i>Rivers</i> into the <i>Sea</i>. And
then we were sure of all the <i>Republicans</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>But after all this</i> Care <i>and</i> Industry<i>, how was it possible for
the business to</i> Miscarry?</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Why I know 'tis laid in our dish, that when we had set<span class="pagenum">[Pg 4]</span>
the whole Kingdome agogg upon <i>Petitioning</i>, our hearts would
not serve us to go through stitch, and so we drew our own
necks out of the Collar, and left the Countries in the Lurch.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Nay that's the Truth on't,</i> Citt<i>; We stood all gaping for</i>
London <i>to lead the way</i>.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> The great work that we look't upon was the gaining of
a <i>well-affected Common-Council</i>; which we secur'd upon the <i>Election</i>,
with all the skill, and watchfullness imaginable.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>And that was a huge point</i> Citt; <i>but how were ye able to
compasse it</i>?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tricks to defeat
Elections.</div>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Why we had no more to do, then to mark those that
we knew were not for our turns, either as <i>Courtiers</i>, or <i>Loose-livers</i>,
or <i>half-Protestants</i>, and their business was done.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>We went the same way to work too in the</i> Country<i>, at all our</i>
Elections; <i>for it is a Lawfull Policy, you know, to lessen the Reputation
of an Enemy</i>.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Nay we went further still; and set a <i>Report</i> a foot upon
the <i>Exchange</i>, and all the <i>Coffee-houses</i> and <i>Publique Houses</i> thereabouts,
which held from <i>Change-time</i>, till the very <i>Rising</i> of the
<i>Common-Councill</i>, when the <i>Petition</i> was <i>laid aside</i>; that past so
currant, that no mortall doubted the Truth on't.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>But you ha' not told me what that</i> Report <i>was yet</i>.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> It was this, <i>that the King had sent a Message to the City to
let them understand that he took notice how much they stood affected to
the</i> Petition; <i>that he expected they would proceed upon it; and that his
Majesty was ready to give them</i> a gracious Answer.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>But was this fair dealing, Brother?</i></p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Did not <i>Abraham</i> say of <i>Sarah, She's my Sister</i>?</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Well thou'rt a heavenly man</i>, Citt! <i>but come to the Miscarriage
it self</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Petition
laid aside in
the <i>Common-Council</i>.</div>

<p><i>Citt.</i> After as Hopefull a <i>Choice</i> as ever was made, we procur'd
a <i>Common-Councill</i>: where the <i>Petition</i> was put to the <i>Vote</i>,
and it was carry'd in the <i>Commons</i> by <i>two Voyces</i>, for the presenting
it, and by <i>Fourteen</i>, or <i>Fifteen Votes</i> in the <i>Court of Aldermen</i>,
on the <i>Negative</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>So that</i> your Damn'd Aldermen<i>, and</i> our Damn'd Justices,
<i>have ruin'd us both in</i> City <i>and</i> Country.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Hang'um, they are most of them <i>Church-Papists</i>; but we
should have dealt well enough with <i>them</i>, if it had not been for<span class="pagenum">[Pg 5]</span>
that confounded <i>Act</i> for <i>Regulating Corporations</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Prethee let me understand that, for I know nothing on't.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Act for
Corporations
brake the neck
on't.</div>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Take notice then that this Devillish Statute has provided,
that <i>no man shall serve as a</i> Common-Councell man, <i>but
upon condition of taking three</i> Oaths, <i>and subscribing</i> one Declaration,
<i>therein mention'd; and having taken the</i> Sacrament <i>of the</i> Lords
Supper, <i>according to the Rites of the Church of</i> England, <i>within
one year next before his Election</i>. Now it so fell out, that what
with this <i>Act</i>, and a <i>Court-Letter</i> for putting it in <i>Execution</i>, a
matter of <i>thirty</i> of our <i>Friends</i> were put <i>by</i>, as not duly qualify'd;
And upon this Pinch we lost it. Nay let me tell ye as a friend,
there were at least <i>twenty</i> or <i>thirty</i> of the rest too, that would
hardly have past Muster.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>But is this certain?</i></p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Why I am now in my Element, <i>Bumkin</i>; for thou
know'st my Education has been toward the Law.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>This was a Plaguy jobb</i>, Citt, <i>but we must look better to
our Hitts next bout</i>.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Nay my life for thine we'll have another touch for't yet.
But tell me in short; how came you off with your <i>Petition</i> in the
<i>Country</i>?</p>

<p>Bum. <i>It went on for a good while prettily well at the</i> Quarter-Sessions;
<i>till at last one</i> Cross-grain'd Curr <i>there upon the</i> Bench
<i>claw'd us all away to the Devill, and got an Order of Court against it,
while you would say what's this</i>.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> But what did he say?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Petition
baffled in the
Country.</div>

<p>Bum. <i>Oh there was a great deal of stuff on't; the</i> King, <i>and the</i>
Judges <i>(he said) had declared it to be</i> Seditious, <i>and so they were
to take it. That they sat there to</i> keep <i>the</i> Kings Peace, <i>not to countenance
the</i> Breaking <i>of it; and then (says he) these fellows don't
know what they would have</i>. One <i>Petitions for</i> Chalk, <i>and</i> Another
<i>for</i> Cheese; <i>the Petition was at first</i> for the meeting of the
Parliament; <i>and then they came to Twit the King with his</i> Coronation-Oath,
<i>and then</i>, Delinquents <i>must be brought to</i> Punishment;
<i>and then the</i> Parliament <i>was to Sit as</i> long <i>as</i> they pleas'd, <i>and at</i>
last, <i>every man must be</i> mark'd <i>for a</i> Common Enemy <i>that would
not</i> Subscribe <i>it. So that first they would have the</i> Parliament Sit;
<i>and then they'd cut 'um out their work; and in fine, it was little other
then a</i> Petition <i>against</i> those <i>that would</i> not Petition. <i>He said
there were Ill practices in the getting of hands, and so they threw out<span class="pagenum">[Pg 6]</span>
the</i> Petition, <i>and order'd an</i> Enquiry <i>into the</i> Abuses.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Well, there's no remedy but Patience.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>I had need of Patience I'm sure, for they're Examining the
Hands allready, as hard as they can drive; You'l see me in the</i> Gazette
next Thursday, <i>as sure as a Gun</i>.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Why then we must play the <i>Domestique</i> against <i>him, next
Fryday</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Nay, I'm sure to be trounc'd for't to some tune, if I be</i> taken.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Pre'thee what art affraid of? There's no <i>Treason</i> in
getting hands to a <i>Petition</i> man.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>No, that's true; but I have put in such a Lurry of</i> Dog-Rogues;
<i>they cry</i> they're defam'd, <i>with a Pox</i>, they'le have their
remedy; <i>and they make such a Bawling</i>.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Come, come, set thy heart at rest: and know that in
this City th'art in the very Sanctuary of the <i>Well-affected</i>. But
'tis good however to prepare for the <i>worst</i>, and the <i>best</i> (as they
say) <i>will help its self</i>. But art thou really afraid of being <i>taken</i>?</p>

<p>Bum. <i>And so would you be too, if you were in my condition, without
a</i> penny, <i>or a</i> friend <i>in the world to help ye</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The blessing
of having neither

nor Mony.</div>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Thou art two great Owls, <i>Bumkin</i>, in a very few words.
<i>First</i>, thou hast <i>great friends</i> and do'st not <i>know on't</i>, and <i>Secondly</i>
thou do'st not understand the <i>Blessing</i>, of having neither <i>Friends</i>,
nor <i>Money</i>. In one word, I'll see thee provided for; and in the
mean time, give me thy answer to a few questions.</p>

<p>I make no doubt but they that put thee into this <i>Trust</i>, and
<i>Employment</i> of helping on the <i>Petition</i>, are men of <i>Estate</i>, and
men <i>well-inclin'd</i> to the <i>Publique Cause</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Methods of
<i>Popularity.</i></div>

<p>Bum. <i>O, their</i> Landlords <i>and</i> Masters <i>are men of huge Estates;
but 'tis the</i> Tenants, <i>and the</i> Stewards <i>that I have to do withall. But
then (do you mark me) those people are all in all with their Masters.</i></p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> I suppose you may be known to the <i>Landlords</i> and <i>Masters
themselves</i> too. Do they ever take any notice of you?</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Yes, yes; I go often to their Houses man, and they speak
mighty kindly to me; and there's nothing but</i> Honest Obadiah, <i>and</i>
Good Obadiah <i>at every turn; and then the Men take me into the
Kitchin, or into the Cellar, or so. And let me tell you</i> Citt, <i>if it
had not been for them once, I had been plaguyly paid off in the</i> Spirituall
Court <i>upon a certain Occasion</i>.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> That's a very good sign of <i>Affection</i> to the <i>Cause</i>, as I
told thee: and it would be never the worse if they were under a<span class="pagenum">[Pg 7]</span>
Cloud at <i>Court</i>; for <i>an Honest Revenge</i>, ye know <i>goes a great way
with a tender Conscience</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>I have hear'd some Inkling that way, but we'le scatter no
words.</i></p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> They never speak any thing to you in private, do they?
As of <i>Grievances</i>, (I mean) <i>Religion, the Liberty of the Subject</i>, and
such like?</p>

<p>Bum. <i>No, no, but they talk as other people do, of the</i> Plot, <i>and
the</i> Jesuits, <i>and</i> Popery, <i>and the</i> French King, <i>and so</i>.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> And what is the reason now, do ye think, that you are
not receiv'd into their <i>Bed-Chambers</i>, their <i>Closets</i>, into their
<i>Arms</i>, and into their very <i>Hearts</i>, as well as some other people
as we know?</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Alas! what should they do with me? I'm not a man fit to
keep them Company.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">A Golden
Sentence.</div>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Why then <i>Honest Bumpkin</i>, here's a Golden Sentence for
thee; <i>Be Taken, Sifted, Imprison'd, Pillory'd</i>, and stand true to
thy <i>Principles</i>, and th'art company for the best <i>Lord</i> in <i>Christendom</i>.
They'l never dare to trust thee till th' art <i>Jayl</i> and <i>Pillory-proof</i>;
and the bringing of <i>thee into</i> a Jayl would be a greater
kindness, then the fetching of <i>Another man Out</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Prethee Cit, tell me one thing by the way, hast thou ever
made Tryal of this Experiment thy self?</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">A Jayl is the
High-way to
Preferment.</div>

<p><i>Citt.</i> To tell thee as a friend, I have try'd it, and I'm the best
part of a thousand pound the better for't. 'Tis certainly the
high way to preferment.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>And yet for all this</i>, Citt, <i>I have no minde in the World to
be</i> taken.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> And that's because th' art an arrant buzzard; the Lord
deliver me from a fellow that has neither <i>Mony</i>, nor <i>Friends</i>,
and yet's afraid of being <i>Taken</i>. Why 'tis the very making of
many a mans Fortune to be <i>Taken</i>. How many men are there
that give mony to be Taken, and make a <i>Trade</i> on't; <i>Nay</i> happy
is the man that can but get any body to <i>Take</i> him. Why I
tell ye, there are people that will <i>quarrel</i> for't, and make <i>Friends</i>
to be <i>Taken</i>. 'Tis a common thing in <i>Paris</i>, for a man in <i>One
six Months</i>, to start out of a <i>Friendless</i>, and <i>Monyless</i> condition,
into an Equipage of <i>Lacquays</i> and <i>Coaches</i>; and all this by nicking
the blessed Opportunities of being <i>discreetly Taken</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>I have heard indeed of a man that set fire to</i> one Old House,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 8]</span>
<i>and got as much Mony by a</i> Brief <i>for't, as built him</i> two New ones.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Have not I my self heard it cast in a fellows Teeth, <i>I
was the making of you</i>, Sirrah, <i>though y' are so high now a body must
not speak to you: You had never been</i> Taken <i>and</i> clapt up, Sirrah,
<i>but for me</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Father! what Simpletons we</i> Country-folks <i>are to you</i> Citizens!</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Now put the case <i>Bumpkin</i>, that you were <i>Taken, Examin'd</i>
and <i>Committed</i>, provided you <i>stand to your Tackle</i>, y'are
a Made man already; but if you <i>shrink in the wetting</i>, y'are lost.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Pray'e what do you mean by</i> standing to my Tackle?</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> You must be sure to keep your self upon a Guard, when
y'are before the <i>Justice</i>; and not to be either <i>wheedled</i>, or
<i>frighten'd</i> into any <i>Discovery</i>; for they'le be trying a thousand
Tricks with you.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>But may I deny any thing that's charg'd upon me, point-blank,
if I be guilty of it?</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">A Salvo for
a Lye.</div>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Yes, in the case of <i>self-preservation</i>, you may; but you
must be sure then that no body can <i>disprove</i> you; for if it be
<i>known</i>, 'tis a <i>Scandall</i>, and no longer <i>Lawfull</i>: Your best way
will be not to answer any Questions against your self.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>But now you have brought me into a</i> Goal, <i>you would do
well to tell me how I shall get out again</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Benefits
of a Prison.</div>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Why before you turn your self thrice in your <i>Kennell</i>,
(if <i>Baylable</i>) Y'are out again, upon a <i>Habeas Corpus</i>: But in the
mean time, the Town rings of your <i>Commitment</i>, the <i>Cause</i> of
it, and how bravely you carry'd it upon your <i>Examination</i>; all
which shall be Reported to your Advantage; and by this time,
y'are Celebrated for the <i>Peoples Martyr</i>. And now come in the

finger upon your Mouth, and keep all as close as if the <i>Fayries</i>
had brought it.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Pre'thee</i>, Citt, <i>wert thou ever bound</i> Prentice <i>to a</i> Statesman?</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> No, not altogether so neither; but I serv'd a Convenient
time in two of his Majesties Houses; and there I learnt
<i>My Politiques</i>; that is to say, in <i>Newgate</i>, and the <i>Gate-house;
Two schools</i> (says one) <i>that send more wise men into the World, then
the</i> four Inns of Court. Now let your suffering be what it will,
the <i>Merit</i> of it will be rated according to the <i>Difficulty</i> and <i>hazzard</i><span class="pagenum">[Pg 9]</span>
of the <i>Encounter</i>: For there's a great difference betwixt the
Venture of a <i>Pillory</i>, and of a <i>Gibbet</i>. But in what case soever;

want neither <i>Mony</i>, nor <i>Law</i>; nor <i>Countenance</i>, nor <i>Friends</i> in
the <i>Court</i>, nor <i>Friends</i> in the <i>Jury</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Hold, hold</i>, Citt; <i>what if all my great Friends should deceive
me at last</i>?</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> They'le never dare to do that, for fear you should deceive
<i>them</i>. I have found the Experiment of it my self, and every
<i>Term</i> yields us fresh Instances of <i>people that make their Fortunes
in a trice, by a generous contempt of Principalities, and Powers</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Thou'rt a brave fellow</i> Citt; <i>but pre'thee what may thy Employment

<div class="sidenote">The Secretary
to a Grand
Committee.</div>

<p><i>Citt.</i> <i>I</i> am at this present, <i>Bumpkin, under the Rose, a Secretary-Extraordinary</i>
to one of the <i>Grand Committees</i> I told thee of; and
my business is to draw up <i>Impeachments, Informations, Articles</i>;
to lick over now and then a <i>Narrative</i>; and to deal with the
<i>Mercuries</i> to publish nothing against the Interest of that Party:
and <i>in fine</i>, there's hardly any thing stirs, but I have a finger in't.
Mine is a business I can tell you, that brings in <i>Money</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>I make no doubt on't</i> Citt: <i>But could ye put me in a way to
get a little money too</i>?</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> We'l talk of that presently. You may think perhaps
now the <i>City-Petition's</i> blown off, that our <i>Committee</i> will have
nothing to do. But, I do assure you, businesse comes in so fast,
upon us, that I shall never be able to go through it without an
<i>Assistant</i>; and if I find you fit for't, you shall be the man.&mdash;Nay
hold, let Me speak, First; do you continue the use of your
<i>Short-hand</i>?</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Yes, I do; and I have mended my</i> Bastard-Secretary <i>very
much since you saw it</i>.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Will you be <i>Just</i>, <i>Diligent</i>, and <i>Secret</i>?</p>

<p>Bum. <i>I'le give you what security you'le ask, for my</i> Truth <i>and</i>
Diligence; <i>and for my</i> Secrecy, I could almost forget to <i>speak</i>.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> That Figure pleases me; but I must shrift you further.
How stands your appetite to <i>Wine</i> and <i>Women</i>?</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Why truly at the rate of</i> other flesh and blood.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> 'Tis not to barr ye neither; but what Liberties ye take,
let them be <i>Private</i>; and either to advance the <i>Common-cause</i>, or
at <i>spare hours</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>You cannot ask or wish more then I'le do.</i><span class="pagenum">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Only a word or two more, and then I'le let you into
my affairs. What course did you propound to your self, in
case your <i>Petition</i> had succeeded? I ask this, because you seem so
much troubl'd at the Disappointment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Other Petitions
upon the
Anvill.</div>

<p>Bum. <i>Why if this</i> Petition <i>had gone</i> on, <i>and the</i> Parliament
<i>had</i> met, <i>I was promis'd four or five</i> Petitions <i>more; One against</i>
Danby, <i>and the Lords in the</i> Tower, <i>another</i> for the Sitting of
this Parliament, till they had gone through all they had to do;
<i>a</i> Third, <i>for taking away the</i> Bishops Votes, <i>a</i> Fourth <i>for the Remove
of</i> Evill Counsellours; <i>and a</i> Fifth <i>for putting the</i> Militia <i>into</i>
Safe hands.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> These points you must know, have been a long time
upon the Anvill; and our Friends have Instructions all over the
Kingdom, to proceed upon them to shew the Miraculous <i>Union</i>
of the Nation. But do you think because the <i>First Petition</i>
has receiv'd a <i>checque</i>, and the <i>Parliament</i> is <i>Prorogu'd</i>, that
therefore <i>the other Petitions must fall to the ground</i>?</p>

<p>Bum. <i>I cannot well see how it should be otherwise.</i></p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Why then let me tell you, <i>Bumpkin</i>, We'l bring the
whole business about again, and carry it on, in spite of Fate:
for we have better <i>heads</i> at work perhaps then you are aware of.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Ay, but what</i> Hands <i>have we</i> Citt? <i>for it will come to that
at last</i>.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Those <i>Heads</i> will find <i>Hands</i>, never trouble your self,
if there should be occasion; but 'tis too early-days for that sport
yet. 'Twas an unlucky thing however to be so surpriz'd; For
our Friends did no more dream of the <i>Sacrament</i>, then of their
<i>Dying day</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Well there's no recalling of what's past: But the Question is
how we shall avoid it for the time to come.</i></p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Nay <i>Bumpkin</i>, there's a Trick worth two of <i>avoiding</i> it,
we'l <i>Take</i> it next bout, and then we're safe; we'l carry it; I'le
undertake by <i>fifty Voices</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>But cannot the</i> Aldermen <i>hinder you from putting it to the
Vote</i>?</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Designe
upon the
Common-Council.</div>

<p><i>Citt.</i> 'Tis the custom of the City I confess, for the <i>Lord
Mayor</i> to <i>Summon</i> and <i>dissolve Common-Councils</i>, and to put all
points to the <i>Question</i>; but we'l finde a cure for that too. 'Tis
a thing we've been a good while about already; the bringing<span class="pagenum">[Pg 11]</span>
down the <i>Authority</i> of the <i>City</i> into the <i>Major part</i> of the <i>Commons</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Now if the</i> Mayor <i>and</i> Aldermen <i>should be aware of this,
they'l never endure it; but we must leave that to time. But hark ye</i>
Citt. <i>I thought our Friends refusing of the</i> Sacrament had been matter
of Conscience.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Distinctions
of Consciences.</div>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Why so it is man, but take notice then, that you are
to distinguish of <i>Consciences</i>: There is, <i>First</i>, a <i>plain, simple Conscience</i>,
and that's a Conscience that will serve well enough to
keep a man <i>Right</i>, if he meet with nothing else to put him <i>out
of the way</i>. And then there's a <i>Conscience</i> of <i>State</i>, or <i>Profit</i>;
and <i>that Conscience</i> yields, as a <i>Less Weight</i> does to a <i>Greater</i>; an
<i>Ounce</i> turns the <i>Scale</i>, but a <i>Pound</i> carries the <i>Ounce</i>, and no body
blames the <i>Weaker</i> for being over-power'd by the <i>stronger</i>. There
is a <i>Conscience</i> of <i>Profession</i> too; which is a <i>Conscience</i> that does
not so much regard the <i>Reason</i> of the <i>thing</i>, as the being <i>True</i> to
a <i>Party</i>, when a man has past his <i>Word</i>: and this is the <i>Conscience</i>
of a man of <i>Honour</i>, that fights for his <i>Whore</i>. There is likewise
a <i>Conscience</i> of <i>Religion</i>, and that's a <i>quiet peaceable Conscience</i>,
that rests in the Affections of the <i>Heart</i>, in submission to
<i>Lawfull Institutions</i>; and in serving <i>God</i>, and doing Good to our
<i>Nighbour</i>, without <i>Noise</i> or <i>Ostentation</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Consciences
of State or
Interest.</div>

<p>Bum. <i>Well, but I see a great many very</i> Consciencious men <i>that
love to</i> Pray <i>and</i> Sing Psalms <i>next the</i> Street, <i>that their Neighbours
may hear 'um; and go up and down</i> shaking of their <a name="Head" id="Head"></a><a href="#Hands">Heads</a>, <i>and</i>
wringing of their Hands, <i>crying out of</i> the Calves <i>of</i> Bethel, <i>and
the</i> High places, Popery, Prelacy, <i>and the</i> Common-Prayer, <i>in
such a manner, that 'twould grieve a bodies heart to see 'um</i>.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> These are <i>Consciencious men Bumpkin</i>, and this is the <i>Conscience</i>
of <i>State</i> or <i>Profit</i>, that I told ye of.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Ay, but I have seen some men in Fits of the</i> Spirit, Jump,
<i>and fling about a</i> Pulpit <i>so desperately, that they set the children a crying</i>
to have 'um let out. <i>One while they'd</i> raise <i>themselves upon their</i>
Tip-toes, <i>and</i> Roar out <i>upon a suddain, you'd have thought they
had been pinch'd with</i> Hot Irons; <i>and then all in an Instant, they'd</i>
Dop down again, <i>that ye could hardly see 'um; And so</i> fall <i>into a</i>
faint, lamenting Voice, <i>like the</i> Grone <i>of a poor woman</i> three
quarters spent in Labour. <i>Nay there was One of 'um that gap'd,
and held his mouth open so long, that People cry'd out</i>, The man has
a Bone in his Throat. <i>Those must needs be very</i> Consciencious
Men, Citt.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> They are so <i>Bumpkin</i>, but 'tis the <i>same Conscience</i> still;<span class="pagenum">[Pg 12]</span>
for it works all manner of ways. We took up this Mode I suppose,
from the <i>Transports</i>, and <i>Grimaces</i> of the <i>Pagan Priests</i>, in
the Ceremony of their <i>Sacrifices</i>, which had a very effectual
operation upon the People.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Nay</i> Citt, <i>these Men have a Holy way of</i> Language <i>too, as
well as of</i> Behaviour, <i>for all their</i> Talk <i>is of</i> Heaven, <i>and</i> Heavenly
things, <i>the</i> Saints <i>and</i> the New Jerusalem; <i>they deal mightily,
in</i> Expositions <i>upon the</i> Viols, <i>and</i> the Little Horn: <i>and then they
are bitterly severe against</i> Wicked Magistrates, <i>and those that</i> Lord
it over Gods Heritage. <i>They are</i> in fine <i>a very</i> Consciencious
<i>sort of People</i>.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Oh beyond question so they are: But this is still a
Branch of the <i>same Conscience</i>. I have known indeed some people
so Transported with this same <i>Talkative Holiness</i>, that it
has been a kind of <i>Spiritual Salivation</i> to 'um, they continue <i>spitting</i>
when they have not one drop of <i>Moisture</i> left 'um in their
<i>Bodies</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Prethee</i> Citt, <i>tell me in Honest</i> English, <i>where shall a body
finde the</i> simple, <i>and the</i> Religious Consciences <i>thou told'st me of</i>?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Not many Religious
Consciences.</div>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Why every man living has the <i>Former</i> of 'um, but takes
no notice on't: But for the <i>Latter</i> sort, 'tis very scarce; and
you shall find more of it perhaps in <i>one Jayle</i>, or in <i>one Hospital</i>,
then in all the <i>Courts</i> of <i>Christendom</i>. It is commonly <i>the
Blessing of men in years</i>, in <i>sicknesse</i>, or <i>in adversity</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Ah</i> Citt, <i>that I were but as capable of Learning as thou
art of Teaching! Pre'thee explain thy self a little upon the</i> Conscience
<i>of</i> Profession <i>too</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Conscience
of Profession.</div>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Observe me what I say then, <i>Bumpkin</i>; There is a <i>Profession</i>,
<i>Particular</i>, and <i>General</i>: <i>Particular</i>, as when <i>One Cavalier</i>
serves another in a <i>Duell</i>, he's oblig'd to't by the <i>Profession</i> of a
<i>Sword-man</i>, without Formalizing upon the <i>Cause</i>. There's a
<i>Conscience</i> of <i>Profession</i> even among the <i>Banditi</i> themselves. What
is it but the <i>Profession</i> of <i>Presbytery</i>, that makes the whole Party
oppose <i>Episcopacy</i>; as the <i>Independents</i> do <i>Presbytery</i>, the <i>Republicans</i>,
<i>Monarchy</i>, and the like.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Now I thought that there might have been</i> Conscience <i>of</i>
State, <i>as well as of</i> Profession <i>in These Cases</i>.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Thou sayst very well, <i>Bumpkin</i>, and so there is, and of
<i>Profit</i> too; and it was much the same Case too, throughout<span class="pagenum">[Pg 13]</span>
the Circle of our Late Revolutions, when we <i>Swore</i> and <i>Vow'd</i>
from the <i>Oaths of Allegiance</i>, and <i>Canonical Obedience</i>, to the
<i>Protestation</i>, the <i>Solemn League and Covenant</i>, the <i>Engagement</i>,
the <i>Negative Oath</i>, the Oath of <i>Abjuration</i>, and so till we
swore round, into the <i>Oath of Allegiance</i> again.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>What do you mean now by your <b>Generall Profession</b>?</i></p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> I mean the <i>Subordination</i> of a <i>Partiall</i> to a <i>Generall</i>, of a
<i>Private Profession</i> to a <i>Publick</i>; as thou seest in the Late Times,
<i>Bumpkin</i>, how strictly the <i>Divided Reformers</i> kept themselves to
This Rule, so long as the <i>Common Enemy</i> was upon his Legs.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>But who do you mean by the <b>Common Enemy</b>?</i></p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> I mean, the <i>Court</i>, and the <i>Church-Party</i>. So long (I
say) all our Brethren of the Separation joyn'd as one man, against
that <i>Inordinate Power</i>; and herein we were <i>Conscienciously
True</i> to our <i>General Profession</i>; but so soon as ever we had
subdu'd that <i>Popish</i> and <i>Tyrannical Interest</i>, through the <i>Conscience</i>
of our <i>General Profession</i>, we then consulted our <i>Particular</i>;
and every man did Conscienciously labour for the Establishment
of <i>his own</i> way. But now we come to the great Nicety of all;
that is to say, the <i>Conscience</i> of making a <i>Conscience</i> of using <i>any
Conscience at all</i>: There's a Riddle for ye, <i>Bumpkin</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>I must confess I do not understand one Bitt on't.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">A Conscience
of using no
Conscience
at all.</div>

<p><i>Citt.</i> That's for want of a Discerning Spirit <i>Bumpkin</i>. What
does <i>Conscience</i> signifie to the <i>Saints</i>, that are deliver'd from the
Fetters of <i>Moral Obligations</i>, by so many <i>Extraordinary</i> and
<i>Over-riding Priviledges</i>, which are granted in a peculiar manner
to the <i>People of the Lord</i>? What's he the <i>better</i>, or the <i>worse</i>, for
<i>keeping</i> or for <i>breaking</i> the <i>Ten Commandments</i>, that lies under
the <i>Predestinarian Fate</i> of an <i>Unchangeable Necessity</i> and <i>Decree</i>?
What needs he care for any <i>other Guide</i>, that carries within
himself an <i>Infallible Light</i>? Or He for <i>any Rule at all</i> that cannot
<i>sin</i>? For the <i>same thing</i> may be <i>sin</i> in <i>another man</i>, which
in <i>Him</i> is <i>None</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Really this is admirable: So that we that are the <b>Elect</b> are
bound up by no <b>Laws</b> at all, either of <b>God</b> or of <b>Man</b>.</i></p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Why look you now for that; we <i>Are</i>, and we are <i>Not</i>.
If it so happens that the <i>Inward</i> and <i>Invisible Spirit</i> move us to
do <i>the same thing</i>, which the <i>Outward</i>, and <i>Visible Law</i> requires
of us; in <i>That Case</i> we are <i>Bound</i>; but so, as to the <i>Spirit</i>, not
to the <i>Law</i>: and therefore we are bid to <i>stand fast in our Christian
Liberty</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Of Christian
Liberty.</div>

<p>Bum. <i>That's extreamly well said, for if <b>We Christians</b> should<span class="pagenum">[Pg 14]</span>
be Shackled with <b>Human Laws</b>, which can only reach the <b>Outward
Man</b>, then are <b>the Heritage of the Lord</b>, in no better Condition
then the <b>Wicked</b>, and the <b>Heathen</b>.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Extent
of it.</div>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Oh! th'art infinitely in the Right: for if it were not for
this <i>Christian Liberty</i>, we could never have <i>Justify'd</i> our Selves
in our <i>Late Transactions</i>: the <i>Designe</i> of <i>Overturning the Government</i>
had been <i>Treason</i>; taking up <i>Arms</i> against the <i>King</i>, <i>Rebellion</i>;
<i>Dividing</i> from the <i>Communion</i> of the <i>Church</i> had been <i>Schism</i>;
appropriating the <i>Church Plate</i>, and <i>Revenues</i> to <i>Private Uses</i>,
had been <i>Sacriledge</i>; Entring upon <i>Sequester'd Livings</i> had been
<i>Oppression</i>: taking away mens <i>Estates</i> had been <i>Robbery</i>; <i>Imprisoning</i>
of their <i>Persons</i> had been <i>Tyranny</i>; using the name of <i>God</i>
to all This, would have been <i>Hypocrisy</i>, forcing of <i>Contradictory
Oaths</i> had been <i>Impiety</i>, and Shedding the <i>Blood</i> both of the <i>King</i>,
and his <i>People</i>, had been <i>Murther</i>: And all This would have
appear'd so to be, if the <i>Cause</i> had come to be <i>Try'd</i> by the
<i>Known Laws</i> either of <i>God</i>, or of <i>Man</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Make us thankfull now! What a blessed State are we in, that
<b>Walk up to our Calling</b>, in <b>Simplicity</b> and <b>Truth</b>, whose <b>Yea</b> is
<b>Yea</b>, and whose <b>Nay</b> is <b>Nay</b>. 'Tis a strange way thou hast, <b>Citt</b>, of
making things out to a man. Thou wert saying but now, that the <b>same
thing</b> may be a <b>Sin</b> in <b>One Man</b>, and <b>not</b> in <b>Another</b>. I'm thinking
now of the <b>Jesuites</b>.</i></p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Oh That's a <i>Jugling, Equivocating, Hellish</i> sort of <i>People</i>;
'tis a thousand pitties that they're suffer'd to live upon the
Earth; They value an <i>Oath</i> no more then they do a <i>Rush</i>. Those
are the <i>Heads</i> of the <i>Plot</i> now upon the Life of the <i>King</i>, the
<i>Protestant Religion</i>, and the <i>Subversion</i> of the <i>Government</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Ay, Ay, <b>Citt</b>, they're a <b>damn'd Generation</b> of <b>Hell-hounds</b>.
But, as I was thinking just now; we have so many things among
<b>Us</b>, like some things among <b>Them</b>, that I have been run down
some times allmost, as if We <b>our selves</b> were <b>Jesuites</b>; though I know
there's as much difference, as betwixt <b>Light</b>, and <b>Darknesse</b>: and for
my part, <b>I defie them as I do the Devill</b>.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">A vast Difference
betwixt
them.</div>

<p><i>But <b>Citt</b> thou hast so wonderfull a way of making matters plain,
I'de give any thing in the world thou'dst but teach me what to say in
some Cases, when I'm put to't. One told me t'other day, <b>You are rather
worse then the</b> Jesuites; (says he) <b>for when </b>They<b> break an
</b>Oath<b>, they have some </b>mental Reservation<b> or other for a </b>Come-off:</i><span class="pagenum">[Pg 15]</span>
But <i>You</i> Swallow your <i>Perjuryes, just</i> as <i>Cormorants</i> do <i>Eeles</i>; an
<i>Oath's</i> no sooner <i>In</i> at <i>One End</i>, then <i>Out</i> at <i>t'other</i>.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Let your Answer be This, <i>Bumpkin</i>, That the <i>Lawmaker</i>
is <i>Master</i> of <i>his own Laws</i>; and that the <i>Spirits dictating</i> of
a <i>New Law</i>, is the <i>Superseding</i> of an <i>Old one</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their Practices

<p>Bum. <i>These are hard words</i>, Citt; <i>but he told me further</i>, don't
<i>You</i> Justifie <i>King-Killing</i> (<i>says he</i>) as well as the <i>Jesuits</i>? Only
<i>They</i> do't with <i>Pistol</i>, <i>Dagger</i>, and <i>Poyson</i>; and <i>You</i> come with
Your <i>Horse</i>, <i>Foot</i>, and <i>Cannon</i>: <i>They</i> proceed by <i>Excomunicating</i>,
and <i>Deposing</i>; by <i>dissolving</i> the <i>Character</i>, <i>first</i>, and <i>then
destroying</i> the <i>Person</i>; and just so did <i>You</i>. <i>First</i>, ye <i>Depos'd</i> the
<i>King</i>, and <i>Then</i> ye <i>Beheaded Charles Stuart</i>. And then you need
never go to <i>Rome</i> for a <i>Pardon</i>, when every man among you is
<i>his own Pope</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Fanaticks
Clear'd.</div>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Now your Answer must be This; That we had, <i>First</i>,
the <i>Warrant</i>, for what we did, of <i>an Extraordinary Dispensation</i>.
(as appear'd in the providence of our Successes) <i>Secondly</i>, we
had the <i>Laws</i> of <i>Necessity</i>, and <i>Self-preservation</i> to Support us.
And <i>Thirdly</i>, the <i>Government</i> being <i>Coordinate</i>, and the <i>King</i> only
<i>One</i> of the <i>Three Estates</i>; any <i>Two</i> of the <i>Three</i> might deal
with the <i>Third</i> as They thought <i>Fit</i>: Beside the <i>Ultimate Soveraignty</i>
of the <i>People</i>, over and above. And now take notice,
that <i>the same Argument</i> holds in the <i>Subversion</i> of the <i>Government</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Now you have Arm'd me Thus far, pray'e help me on, one
step farther; for I was hard put to't not long Since, about the businesse
of the</i> Protestant Religion. <i>What is</i> That, <i>I pray'e, that ye call the</i>
Protestant Religion?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Of Dissenting
Protestants.</div>

<p><i>Citt.</i> You are to understand, that by the <i>Protestant Religion</i> is
meant the <i>Religion</i> of the <i>Dissenters</i> in <i>England</i>, from the <i>Church</i>
of <i>England</i>; As the <i>First Protestants</i> in <i>Germany</i> 1529. (from
whom we denominate our Selves) were <i>Dissenters</i> from the
<i>Church</i> of <i>Rome</i>: And So <i>Call'd</i> from the famous <i>Protestation</i>
they enter'd against the <i>Decree</i> of the <i>Assembly</i> at <i>Spires</i>, against
<i>Anabaptists</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>So that I perceive We</i> Set up <i>the</i> Protestant Religion; <i>we
did not</i> Destroy <i>it: But they prest it Then, that the</i> Church of
England <i>was a</i> Protestant Church, <i>and that the</i> Jesuites <i>had only</i>
Design'd <i>the</i> Destruction <i>of it, where as</i> We <i>did</i> Actually Execute
<i>it</i>.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Your Answer must be, that the <i>Church</i> of <i>England</i>,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 16]</span>
though it be a little <i>Protestantish</i>, it is not yet directly <i>Protestant</i>:
As on the Other side, it is not altogether the <i>Whore</i> of <i>Babilon</i>,
though a good deal <i>Whorish</i>; and therefore the Reply to That
must be, that we did not <i>Destroy</i>, but only <i>Reform</i> it.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Why I have answer'd People out of my Own</i> Mother-Wit,
<i>that we did but</i> Reform <i>it</i>. <i>And they told me again, the Cutting of it
off</i> Root and Branch, <i>was a very Extraordinary way of</i> Reforming.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The meaning
of Root and
Branch.</div>

<p><i>Citt.</i> The Answer to That is Obvious, that the <i>Cutting Off
Root and Branch</i>, is only a <i>Thorow</i>, or a <i>Higher degree</i> of <i>Reforming</i>.
But upon the whole matter, it was with <i>Us</i> and the <i>Jesuites</i>,
as it was with <i>Aaron</i> and the <i>Magicians</i>; we did <i>Both</i> of us, make
<i>Froggs</i>, but <i>We alone</i> had the Power to quicken <i>the Dust of the
Land, and turn it into Lice</i>.</p>

<p>Thou art by this time, I presume, sufficiently instructed in the
<i>Methods</i>, and <i>Fundamentalls</i> of the <i>Holy Cause</i>. I shall now give
you some necessary Hints, to fit, and quallify you for the Province
that I intend you. But besure you mind your <i>Lesson</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>As I would do my</i> Prayers, Citt, <i>or I were Ungratefull,
for you have made me for ever.</i></p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Come we'l take <i>t'other Sup</i>, first, and then to work. <i>Who
wayts there without? Two Potts more, and shut the door after Ye.</i></p>

<br>

<p>A great part of Your businesse, <i>Bumpkin</i>, will ly among
<i>Parliament-Rolls</i> and <i>Records</i>; for it must be <i>Our Post</i> to furnish
<i>Materialls</i> to a <i>Caball</i> only of <i>Three Persons</i>, that may be
ready upon Occasion, to be made use of by the <i>Grand Committee</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rolls and Records
hunted
for Presidents.</div>

<p>Bum. My <i>Old Master would say that I had as good a guesse at a</i>
Musty Record, <i>as any man; And 'twas my whole Employment almost,
to hunt for</i> Presidents. <i>Nay the People would Trust me with</i>
Great Bags <i>home to my Lodging; and leave me alone sometimes in
the</i> Offices <i>for four and twenty hours together.</i></p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> But what kind of <i>Presidents</i> were they that Ye lookt
for?</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Concerning the</i> Kings Prerogative, Bishops Votes, <i>the</i>
Liberty <i>and</i> Property <i>of the</i> Subject; <i>and the like: And such as
They wanted, I writ out.</i></p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> But did you Recite them <i>Whole</i>? or what did you <i>Take</i>,
and what did you <i>Leave</i>?</p>

<p>Bum. <i>We took what serv'd our Turn, and left out the Rest; and<span class="pagenum">[Pg 17]</span>
sometimes we were taken <b>Tripping</b>, and sometimes we <b>Scap'd</b>: But
we never falsify'd any thing. There were some dogged Passages, indeed
we durst not meddle with at all; but I can turn ye to any thing
you have occasion for, with a wet-finger.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Lessons of behaviour
for
the Well-affected.</div>

<p><i>Citt.</i> So that here's One great point quickly over; in thy being
Train'd to my hand: A man might lay thee down <i>Instructions</i>,
now, for thy very <i>Words</i>, <i>Looks</i>, <i>Motions</i>, <i>Gestures</i>; nay
thy very <i>Garments</i>; but we'l leave those matters to Time, and
Study. It is a strange thing how Nature puts her self forth, in
these <i>Externall Circumstances</i>. Ye shall Know a <i>Sanctifi'd Sister</i>, or
a <i>Gifted Brother</i> more by the <i>Meene</i>, <i>Countenance</i>, and <i>Tone</i>, then
by the Tenour of their <i>Lives</i>, and <i>Manners</i>. It is a Comely thing
for Persons of the Same Perswasion, to agree in these <i>Outward
Circumstances</i>, even to the <i>drawing</i> of the <i>same Tone</i>, and <i>making</i>
of the <i>same Face</i>: Always provided, that there may be read in
our <i>Appearances</i>, a <i>Singularity of Zeal</i>, a <i>Contempt of the World</i>, a
<i>fore-boding of Evills to come</i>; a <i>dissatisfaction at the Present Times</i>;
and a <i>Despair of Better</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Why This is the very Part, that I was Made for; these
Humours are to be put <b>On</b>, and <b>Off</b>, as a man would shift his <b>Gloves</b>;
and you shall see me do't as Easily too; but the <b>Language</b> must be got,
I Phansy, by Conversing with <b>Modern Authours</b>, and frequenting
<b>Religious Exercises</b>.</i></p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Yes, yes, and for a help to your memory I would advise
you to dispose of your Observations into these <i>Three Heads</i>,
<i>Words</i>, <i>Phrases</i>, and <i>Metaphors</i>: Do you conceive me?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Force of
Looks and
Tones.</div>

<p>Bum. <i>There's not a word you say, falls to the Ground. And I am
the more sensible of the force of <b>Words</b>, <b>Looks</b>, <b>Tones</b>, and <b>Metaphors</b>
(as ye call 'um) from what I finde in my self. <b>Ours</b> certainly
may be well term'd a <b>Powerfull Ministry</b>, that makes a man cry like
a Child at the very <b>Noyse</b> of a Torrent of <b>Words</b> that he does not
<b>Understand One Syllable</b> of. Nay, when I have been out of reach of
hearing the <b>Words</b>, the very <b>Tone</b> and <b>Look</b>, has <b>Melted</b> me.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">A Moving
Metaphor.</div>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Thou canst not but have heard of <i>That Moving Metaphor</i>
of the late Reverend <i>Mr. Fowler</i>: <i>Lord Sowse us;</i> (says he)
<i>Lord Dowse us, in the Powdering-Tubb of Affliction; that we may
come forth Tripes worthy of thy Holy Table.</i> Who can resist the <i>Inundation</i>
of This <i>Rhetorique</i>? But let us now pass from the <i>Generall
Ornaments</i> of our <i>Profession</i>, to the <i>Particular businesse</i> of our
<i>present Case</i>.</p>

<p>I need not tell you, <i>Bumpkin</i>, of the <i>Plott</i>, or that we are all<span class="pagenum">[Pg 18]</span>
running into <i>Popery</i>; and that the best Service <i>Englishman</i>
can do his Country, would be the ripping up of This Designe
to the <i>Bottom</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>I am so much of Your Opinion, that you have Spoken my very
Thoughts.</i></p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Bethink your self, <i>Bumpkin</i>; what <i>Papists</i> do you
know?</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Oh, hang 'um all, I never come near any of 'Um.</i></p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> But yet you may have Heard, perhaps, of some people
that are <i>Popishly affected</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Yes, yes; There are abundance of Them.</i></p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Can you prove that ever they <i>Sayd</i>, or <i>Did</i> any thing,
in favour of the <i>Papists</i>?</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Nay there's enough of That I believe; but then there are
such</i> Huge Great men among 'um.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Pluck up a good heart <i>Bumpkin</i>; the <i>Greater</i>, the <i>Better</i>;
We fear 'um not. Rub up your Memory, and call to minde
what you can say upon <i>Your own Knowledge</i>, and what you have
<i>Heard</i>; either about <i>Sir Edmond-Bury Godfrey</i>, The <i>Plott</i>; The
<i>Traytors</i> that Suffer'd, or the <i>Kings Evidence</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>I have seen people</i> shrug <i>sometimes, and lift up their</i> Hands
<i>and</i> Eyes, <i>and shake their</i> Heads, <i>and then they would clutch their</i>
Fists, <i>look sour</i>, <i>make</i> Mouths, <i>and bite their</i> Nails, <i>and so: And
I dare swear I know what they thought.</i></p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Ah <i>Bumpkin</i>, if they had but so much as mutter'd, they'd
been our own.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Signs in Evidence.</div>

<p>Bum. <i>Well but hark ye</i> Citt, <i>I hear People swear</i>, or in WORDS
to this Effect; <i>why may not a Man as well swear</i>, in SIGNS to
this Effect? <i>and that they lifted up their</i> Eyes, <i>and</i> hands, <i>bent their</i>
Fists, <i>knit their</i> Brows, <i>and made</i> Mouths, to this or that Effect?</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> No, that will never do <i>Bumpkin</i>, but if thou could'st but
phansy that thou heard'st them <i>speak</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Why truly I never thought on't, but I saw a</i> Parson <i>once, the
Tears flood in his Eyes, as one of 'um went by to Execution. But your</i>
Surcingle-men, (<i>as our Doctor told us last Lords day</i>) <i>are all of 'um</i>
Papists in their Hearts.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Why what's the <i>Common-Prayer Book Bumpkin</i>, but a
mess of <i>Parboyl'd Popery</i>?</p>

<p>Bum. <i>I'm a dog, if our Minister does not pray for the</i> Queen <i>still.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sad Times.</div>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Nay, we are e'en at a fine pass, when the <i>Pulpit</i> prays<span class="pagenum">[Pg 19]</span>
for the <i>Queen</i>, and the <i>Bench</i> Drinks the <i>Duke of Yorks Health</i>.
But to the point, bethink your self well; a man may forget a
thing to day, and recollect it to morrow. Take notice however,
that it is another main point of your Instructions to procure <i>Informations</i>
of this quality.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>I'le fit you to a hair for that matter: But then I must be running
up and down ye know, into</i> Taverns, <i>and</i> Coffee-houses, <i>and
thrusting myself into</i> Meetings, <i>and</i> Clubs. <i>That licks mony.</i></p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Never trouble your self for that, you shall be well paid
and your expences born: Beside so much a head from the State,
for every Priest that you discover.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Well! these</i> Priests <i>and</i> Jesuites <i>are damn'd fellows.</i></p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> And yet let me tell you <i>Bumpkin</i>, a <i>bare fac'd Papist</i> is not
half so bad as a <i>Papist</i> in <i>Masquerade</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Why what are those I prethee?</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Church
worse to Dissenters
then
Jesuites.</div>

<p><i>Citt.</i> They are your <i>Will-worship-men</i>, your <i>Prelates Brats</i>:
Take the whole Litter of 'um, and you'l finde <i>never a barrel better
Herring</i>. Let me tell thee in Love <i>Bumpkin, these Curs</i> are forty
times worse to <i>Us</i> then the <i>Jesuits themselves</i>; for the <i>One</i> is
an <i>Open Enemy</i>, the <i>Other</i> lies gnawing like a Canker in our <i>Bowells</i>.
And then being train'd up to <i>Latin</i> and <i>Greek</i>, there's no opposing
of the <i>Power of Godlinesse</i> to the <i>Sophistry</i> of <i>Human Reason</i>:
Beside that, the <i>Law</i> is <i>For</i> us in the <i>One</i> Case, and <i>Against</i>
us in the <i>Other</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Which way shall we go to work then, to deal with this Generation
of Men?</i></p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> We must joyn the <i>Wisdom</i> of the <i>Serpent</i>, to the <i>Innocence</i>
of the <i>Dove</i>; and endeavour to compass that by <i>stratagem</i>,
which we cannot gain by <i>Argument</i>. But now am I going to open
a <i>Mistery</i> to thee, that's <i>worth</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Prethee the</i> Worth <i>on't</i> Citt: <i>For talk is but talk, the</i>
Worth <i>is the</i> Main point.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Why then let me tell thee <i>Bumpkin</i>, the <i>Mistery</i> that I
am about to disclose to thee, was <i>worth</i> to our Predecessours not
long since, no less then <i>Three Kingdoms</i>, and <i>a better penny</i>. But
I'le seal your Lips up, before I stir one step further.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Why look ye</i> Citt, may this Drink never go thorough
me, if ever blab one Syllable of any thing thou tell'st me as a
Secret.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Hold, hold, <i>Bumkin</i>, and <i>may it never come up again if</i><span class="pagenum">[Pg 20]</span>
<i>thou do'st</i>; for we'l have no shifting.</p>

<p>Bum. And may it never come up again neither if I do.</p>

<br>

<div class="sidenote">The strange
agreement of
Dissenters.</div>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Well, I'm satisfy'd, and now give attention; thou seest
how unanimously fierce all the several Parties of the <i>Protestant
Dissenters</i> are against the <i>Papists</i>. Whence comes this <i>Conjunction</i>,
I prethee, of so many <i>separate Congregations</i>, that are many
of them worse then <i>Papists, One</i> to <i>Another</i>? There must be in
it, either <i>Conscience</i>, or <i>Interest</i>: If it were <i>Conscience</i>, we should
fall foul <i>One</i> upon <i>Another</i>, and for matter of <i>Interest</i>; when the
<i>Papists</i> are <i>destroy'd</i>, we are but still where we were.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>This is a crotchet</i>, Citt, <i>that did not fall under my Night-Cap.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">The scope of
that Agreement.</div>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Be enlighten'd then. It is not the Destruction of those
that are <i>Really Papists</i>, that will do our Work; for there's nothing
to be got by't. But it must be our business to make <i>those
people</i> pass for <i>Papists</i>, that are <i>not</i> so, but only have <i>Places</i> to
Lose: such as we our selves, by the removal of them, may be
the better for; and <i>This, Bumpkin</i> must be <i>our Master-piece</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>I had this very phansy my self</i>, Citt; <i>but it stuck betwixt my
Teeth, and would not out.</i></p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> You hear now in General, what is to be done; You
must be next instructed in the Acts of <i>Raising</i>, <i>Cherishing</i>, and
<i>Fomenting</i> such <i>Opinions</i>; in what Cases to <i>Improve</i> them, and
where to <i>apply</i> them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Who are Popishly
affected
in the first
place.</div>

<p>Bum. <i>I'm perswaded my Masters Brother had this very thing in his
Head, though he never made any words on't to me, He had got a List
of all the considerable Offices and Employments in the Kingdom: And
I remember he was us'd to say, that most of the respective</i> Officers
<i>were either</i> Corrupt, <i>or</i> Popishly affected. <i>If they were</i> Publick Ministers;
<i>either the</i> Kings Councells <i>were</i> betray'd, <i>or they put him
upon Governing in an</i> Arbitrary way, <i>and without</i> Parliaments:
<i>As for the</i> Judges <i>there was either</i> Bribery, Absolute Power, <i>or</i>
Oppression <i>laid to their Charge; and so all the rest were branded for</i>
Frauds, Imbezilments, <i>and the like, according to the Quality of
their businesse: All the</i> Governours <i>of</i> Towns, Castles, <i>and</i> Forts,
<i>were</i> Popishly Inclin'd; <i>and not to be Trusted. And then all</i> Ecclesiasticall
Officers, <i>whatsoever, within four or five, were half way at</i>
Rome <i>already.</i></p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> This is well remembred, <i>Bumpkin</i>; Now 'tis worth a<span class="pagenum">[Pg 21]</span>
bodies while to make <i>these Blades</i> passe for <i>Papists</i>, and <i>Traitors</i>,
that leave <i>Good Offices</i> behinde 'um. Nay, we must not
suffer so much as any man, either of <i>Brains</i>, or <i>Fortune</i> (that
does not joyn with <i>Us</i>) to passe untainted.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Thou say'st Right</i>, Citt; <i>for whosoever is not</i> With <i>us, is</i>
Against <i>us.</i></p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Thou hast spoken patt to This point, <i>Bumpkin</i>, but
yet thou begin'st at the wrong End; For you must first get the
skill of <i>Raising</i>, and <i>Improving a Report</i>, before ye come to the
<i>Fixing</i> of it: For that's a Nicety not to be medled with, till
we come to the taking out of the very Pins, and the Unhinging
of the Government; So that the <i>First Clamour</i> must be Level'd
point-blank at some <i>Known</i>, and <i>Eminent Papists</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Well, but what shall we</i> Charge 'um with?</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Why, if we were Once at the bottom of <i>This Plot</i>
(which, upon my soul, <i>Bumpkin</i>, is a most hideous one) and
wanted <i>matter</i> for <i>Another</i>, I would charge them with a designe
of betraying us to a <i>Foreign Enemy</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>As how a</i> Foreign Enemy <i>pre'thee?</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">A Heavy
Charge.</div>

<p><i>Citt.</i> As Thus: I would charge 'um with holding an Intelligence
with the Emperor of <i>Morocco</i>, for the Landing of <i>five and
thirty thousand Light-horse men</i> upon <i>Salisbury Plain</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Pre'thee</i>, Citt, <i>don't</i> Romance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nothing Incredible.</div>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Pre'thee do not <i>Balderno</i>, ye should say; Speak <i>Statutable
English</i>, ye Fool you. Thou think'st perhaps that the people
will not believe it: Observe but what I say to thee; let it but
be put into the <i>Protestant Domestique</i>, that his <i>Imperiall Majesty</i>
is to hold up his hand at the <i>Kings Bench-barr</i> for't, and let me
be Dogs-meat if they do not swallow That too. Why pre'thee,
<i>Bumkin</i>, we must make 'um believe stranger Things than This,
or we shall never do our businesse. They must be made to believe
that the <i>King</i> intends to play the <i>Tyrant</i>; that all his <i>Counsellors</i>
are <i>Pensioners</i> to the <i>French King</i>; that all his <i>Enemies</i> are
turn'd his <i>Friends</i>, o'th sodain, and all his <i>Friends</i>, his <i>Enemies</i>;
That <i>Prelacy</i> is <i>Anti-Christian</i>; all our <i>Clergy-men</i>, <i>Papists</i>, the
<i>Liturgy</i> the <i>Masse-Book</i>, and that the <i>Ten Commandments</i> are to
be read <i>backward</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Blesse me</i>, Citt, <i>what do I hear?</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Popish Ministers
may have
Orthodox Offices.</div>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Come, come, Sirrah; y'are under an Oath; and This<span class="pagenum">[Pg 22]</span>
is the plain Truth on'. What is it to Thee and Me, I pre'thee,
whether the <i>Great Ministers</i> be <i>True</i>, or <i>False</i>; Or what <i>Religion</i>,
the <i>Clergy</i> are of, so long as their <i>Livings</i> ye Rogue, are <i>Orthodox</i>,

<p>Bum. <i>This does Qualifie, I must confess. But you were saying,
that the First Clamour should be levell'd at some</i> Known <i>and</i> Eminent
Papists: <i>Now what comes after That, I beseech you?</i></p>

<p><i>Citt</i>. You may safely Mark all Their Friends then for <i>Popishly-Affected</i>;
and so consequently <a name="on_all" id="on_all"></a><a href="#on_all1">on to all</a> that <i>Love them</i>, and
all that <i>They Love</i>. When this Opinion is once started, 'tis
an Easy matter, by the help of <i>Invention</i>, and <i>Story</i>, to improve
it; and by this means we shall come, in a short time to secure
all the <i>Councils</i> of the Nation to <i>our Party</i>, that are chosen by
<i>Suffrage</i>. If you were read in History you would finde, that still <i>as
the</i> Papists <i>set the House on fire, the</i> Non-conformists <i>took the Opportunity
of rosting their own Eggs</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Who are Popishly

<p>Bum. <i>Yes, yes, I understand ye. As for Example now,</i> One <i>goes
to the</i> Lords <i>in the</i> Tower, another (<i>as you were saying</i>) <i>drinks
the</i> Dukes Health, <i>a</i> Third <i>prays for the</i> Queen: <i>a</i> Fourth <i>Phansies</i>
Two Plots; <i>a</i> Fifth <i>refuses the</i> Petition, <i>a</i> Sixth <i>speaks well of

<i>All these now are</i> Popishly-Affected.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Save your breath <i>Bumpkin</i>, and take all in one word:
whosoever will not do as we would have him shall be <i>made</i> so.</p>

<p>But now to the matter of <i>Invention</i>, and <i>Story</i>; I hate the over-hearing
of Discourses, in Blinde Allyes, and such ordinary
<i>Shams</i>: I'm rather for coming downright to the <i>Man</i>, and to
the <i>Poynt</i>; after the way of the Protestant Domestique.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Matters of

<p>Bum. <i>Ay, ay: There's your</i> free Speaker. <i>Well</i> Citt, the King
wants such men about him. <i>But pre'thee hear me; Is it certain his
Majesty has Lent the King of</i> France Three Millions?</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> No, no; some Two and a half; or thereabouts.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Why, if the King would but make a League now with the</i>
Swiss <i>to keep the</i> Turk <i>off</i>, That way; <i>and another with the</i> Protestants
<i>in</i> Hungary, <i>to keep off the</i> French, <i>the whole world could
never hurt us.</i></p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Nay that's true enough, but then the <i>Pole</i> lies so damnably
betwixt <i>Us</i> and the <i>Baltique</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>I'de not value that a Half-penny, so long as we have the</i>
Waldenses <i>to Friend.</i></p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> And then <i>New-England</i> lies so conveniently for <i>Provisions</i>.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 23]</span>
But what do you think of drawing <i>Nova Scotia</i>, and <i>Geneva</i>
into the <i>Alliance</i>?</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Ay, but there's no hope of that: so long at the King follows
these Counsells.</i></p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Thou art a great Read man I perceive in the <i>Interests of
States</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>I have always had a phansy to</i> Stows Survey <i>of</i> London,
<i>and those kinde of Books.</i></p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> But Good <i>Bumpkin</i>, what's thy Opinion of the <i>Bishops
Votes</i>, in Case of <i>Life and Death</i>?</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Ay, or in Cases of</i> Heaven and Hell <i>either. Why as true
as thou art a man</i> Citt, <i>we have but</i> three Protestant Bishops <i>in the
Nation; and I am told they are warping too.</i></p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Prethee why should we look for any <i>Protestant Bishops</i> in
the <i>Kingdom</i>, when there's no <i>Protestant Episcopacy</i> in the <i>World</i>?
but for all this, we may yet live to see the <i>Rufling</i> of their <i>Lawn
sleeves</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Oh, now I think on't; dist thou ever reade the Story of</i>
Moses <i>and the</i> Ten Tables?</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> The <i>Two Tables</i> in the <i>Mount</i> thou mean'st.</p>

<p>Bum. Gad <i>I think 'tis the</i> Two Tables. <i>I read it in Print t'other
day, in a very good Book, that as sure as thou art alive now,</i> the Bishops
in <i>Henry the 8th.</i> made the <i>Ten Commandments.</i></p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Why that was the reason, <i>Bumpkin</i>, when the <i>Lords and
Commons</i> put down <i>Bishops</i>, they put down the <i>Ten Commandments
too</i>; and made <i>New ones</i> of their <i>Own</i>. And dost not thou
take notice that they put down the <i>Lords Prayer</i> too, because
'twas akinn to the <i>Popish Pater-Noster</i>? and then for the <i>Creed</i>,
they cast it quite out of the <i>Directory</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Now as thou lay'st it down to me, the Case is as clear as
Christal. And yet when I'm by my self sometime, I'm so affraid methinks
of being</i> Damn'd.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> What for, ye Fop you?</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Why for</i> Swearing, Lying, Dissembling, Cheating,
Betraying, Defaming<i>, and the like.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Brethren
are only for

<p><i>Citt.</i> Put it at worst, do not you know that every man must
have his <i>Dos</i> of <i>Iniquity</i>? And that what you take out in <i>One
way</i> you abate for in <i>another</i>, as in <i>Profaning, Whoring, Drinking</i>,
and so forth. Suppose you should see P O Y S O N set in Capital<span class="pagenum">[Pg 24]</span>

half-starv'd</i>, and <i>Heart-broken</i> Condition, grow <i>Merry,
Fat</i>, and <i>Lusty</i>, would not you venture too? Imagine These <i>Seven</i>
<i>Waters</i> to be the <i>Seven Deadly Sins</i>, and then make your <i>Application</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Nay, the Case is plain enough, and I cannot see why that
should be a</i> Poyson <i>to</i> me, <i>that's a</i> Preservative <i>to</i> Another: <i>Only
our Adversaries twit us with Objections of</i> Law <i>forsooth, and</i> Religion.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Wherefore the Discipline of the Late Times sav'd a
great deal of puzzle. Mr. <i>Prynn</i> sent <i>His Clients</i> to Mr. C<i>ase</i> for
<i>Religion</i>; and Mr. <i>Case</i>, in requital, sent <i>His</i> to Mr. <i>Pryn</i> for
<i>Law</i>; which kept up a concord among the <i>Well-affected</i>. But your
Lesson in both these Cases, falls into a very Narrow compass.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Pray'e let it be</i> Plain <i>that I may</i> understand <i>it; and</i> short
<i>that I may</i> Remember <i>it.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Three Positions.</div>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Keep close only to these <i>Three Positions: First</i>, that the
<i>King</i> is <i>One</i> of the <i>Three Estates; Secondly</i>, that the <i>Sovereign
Power</i> is in the <i>People</i>; and <i>Thirdly</i>, that it is better to obey <i>God</i>,
then <i>Man</i>. These Fundamentals will serve to guide ye in allmost
any dispute upon this Matter, that can occur to you.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>But what becomes of me, if my Adversaries should turn
the question another way?</i></p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> I'le fortify you there too. And let me tell you that
he'l have much ado to keep himself Clear of one of these Two
Rocks: Either of Dashing upon the <i>Plott</i>, or upon the <i>Liberty
of the Subject</i>. As for Example,</p>

<br>

<div class="sidenote">L'Estrange
Confuted.</div>

<p>There's <i>L'Estrange</i>; as wary a Dog perhaps, as ever pist;
and yet ye shall see how we have hamper'd Him. I writ the
thing my self, ye must know, though it comes out in the Name
of <i>the Authour of the Weekly Pacquet of Advice from</i> Rome. 'Tis
Dedicated to <i>Both Houses of Parliament</i>; and Design'd just for
the 26th. of <i>January</i>: So that if the Parliament had Set, there
would have been means us'd to have had him Question'd for't.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Gad, I know where y'are now. 'Tis in the</i> Preface <i>to the</i>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Ay, that's it. I'le give ye First, the <i>Words</i> in't that<span class="pagenum">[Pg 25]</span>
concern <i>L'Estrange</i>, and you shall <i>Then</i> see the <i>Writings</i> of <i>His</i>
that I have reflected upon.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Oh, 'Tis a devilish witty Thing,</i> Citt; <i>I have seen it. Methinks
the Rogue, should hang himself out of the way. I'le go to</i> Mans
Coffee-house <i>and see how he Looks on't.</i></p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> No, no, Pox on him; he's an Impudent Curr; nothing
less than a Pillory will ever put Him out of Countenance.
This Toad was in <i>Newgate</i>, I know not how long; and yet he'l
take no warning.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>You must consider,</i> Citt, <i>that he writes for</i> Money; O my
Soul, they say, the Bishops have given him five hundred Guynnyes.
<i>But pre'thee</i> Citt; <i>hast not thou seen</i> the Answer to the Appeal,
Expounded.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Yes, but I ha' not read it.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Why then take it from me,</i> Citt, <i>'tis one of the shrewdest</i>
<i>Pieces that ever came in Print.</i> L'Estrange, <i>you must know, wrote an</i>
Answer <i>to the</i> Appeal.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> We've a sweet Government the while, that any man
should dare to fall foul upon <i>That Appeal</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. <i>Well, but so it is; and</i> Another <i>has written Notes upon</i>
Him: <i>You cann't imagine</i> Citt, <i>how he windes him about's Finger;
And calls him</i> Fidler, Impudent, Clod-pate; <i>and proves him to
be a</i> Jesuite, <i>and a</i> Papist, <i>as plain as the Nose of a mans Face: he

<p><i>Citt.</i> I have known the man a great while; and let me tell ye

<div class="sidenote"><i>Citt's</i> Faculty

<p><i>True.</i> Very-good; And <i>You</i> are the <i>Representative</i> (forsooth)
of the City, and <i>You</i>, of the <i>Country. Two</i> of the <i>Pillars</i> of the
<i>Nation</i>, with a Horse-Pox; A man would not let down his
Breeches in a House of Office that had but <i>Two such Supporters</i>.
Do not I know you, <i>Citt</i>, to be a little <i>Grubstreet-Insect</i>, that
but t'other day scribled Handy-dandy for some <i>Eighteen-pence</i> a
<i>Job</i>, <i>Pro</i> and <i>Con</i>, and glad on't too? And now, as it pleases
the stars, you are advanc'd from the <i>Obort</i>, the <i>Miscarriage</i>, I
mean, of a <i>Cause-splitter</i>, to a <i>Drawer-up</i> of <i>Articles</i>: and for
your skill in <i>Counterfeiting hands</i>, preferr'd to be a <i>Sollicitor</i> for
<i>Fobb'd Petitions</i>: You'l do the <i>Bishops bus'nesse</i>, and You'l do the
<i>Dukes bus'nesse</i>; And who but <i>You</i>, to tell the <i>King</i> when he
shall make <i>War</i>, or <i>Peace</i>; call <i>Parliaments</i>, and <i>whom</i> to <i>Commit</i>,
and <i>whom</i> to <i>let go</i>? And then in your Fuddle, up comes
all; what such a Lord told you, and what you told him; and
all this Pudder against your Conscience too, even by your own
Confession.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Y'are very much Mis-inform'd of Me, Sir.</p>

<p><i>True.</i> Come, I know ye too well to be mistaken in you; and
for your part, <i>Bumpkin</i>, I look upon you only as a simple Fellow
drawn in.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Bumpkins</i>
account of
himself.</div>

<p>Bum. <i>Not so</i> simple <i>neither, it may be, as you take me for. I was
a</i> Justices Clerk <i>in the</i> Countrey, <i>till the bus'nesse of the</i> Petitions;
<i>and my Master was an Honest Gentleman too, though he's now put
out of Commission: And to shew ye that I am none of your</i> simple
Fellows (<i>do ye mark</i>) <i>if ye have a minde to dispute upon</i> Three
Points, <i>I'm for you.</i> First, <i>the</i> King <i>is</i> One <i>of the</i> Three Estates;<span class="pagenum">[Pg 27]</span>
Secondly, <i>the</i> Sovereign Power <i>is in the</i> People. <i>And</i> Thirdly,
<i>'Tis better to Obey</i> God <i>then</i> Man.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Always provided, <i>Bumpkin</i>, that the Gentleman take
no advantage of what's spoken in Discourse.</p>

<p><i>True.</i> No, there's my hand I will not; and now let's fall to
work. If the King of <i>England</i> be <i>One</i> of the <i>Three Estates</i>, then
the <i>Lords</i> and <i>Commons</i> are <i>two Thirds</i> of the <i>King of England</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Bumpkin's</i>

<p>Bum. <i>Oh pox, you've a minde to put a sham upon the Plot, I
perceive.</i></p>

<p><i>True.</i> Nay, if y'are thereabouts:&mdash;Well; If the <i>Soveraignty</i>
be in the <i>People</i>, why does not the <i>Law</i> run In the Name of our
<i>Sovereign Lords</i> the People?</p>

<p>Bum. <i>This is a meer</i> Jesuitical Trick, <i>to disparage the</i> Kings
Witnesses; <i>for</i> They <i>are part of the</i> People. <i>Now do you take
up the Cudgels</i>, Citt.</p>

<p><i>True.</i> Do so, and we'l make it a short business, and let's have
no shifting.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Composition
of the
Committees.</div>

<p>Now to shew ye that I gave good heed to your Discourse, I'le
run over the Heads of it as you deliver'd them. First, for <i>Committees</i>,
and <i>Grand Committees</i>, what are they compounded of,
but <i>Republicans</i>, and <i>Separatists</i>, a Medly of People disaffected
both to <i>Church</i> and <i>State</i>? This you cannot deny; and that
they would not suffer any man otherwise affected, to mingle
with them. Now beside the <i>scandal</i>, and <i>Ill Example</i> of such
<i>Irregular Conventions</i>, whoever considers their <i>Principles</i>, may
reasonably conclude upon their <i>Designs</i>: For they are wiser, I
hope, then to lay their Heads together to destroy themselves.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> But it is hard, if <i>Protestants</i> may not meet as well as Other
People.</p>

<p><i>True.</i> Yes, <i>Protestants</i> may meet, but not in the quality of
<i>Conspirators</i>, no more then <i>Conspirators</i>, may meet under the
<i>Cloak</i>, and <i>colour</i> of <i>Protestants</i>. The intent of the <i>Meeting</i> is matter
of <i>State</i>, and you turn it off, to a point of <i>Religion</i>.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> But is it not matter of <i>Religion</i> to joyn in a <i>Petition</i> for
the meeting of a <i>Parliament</i>, to bring <i>Malefactors</i> to a <i>Tryall</i>,
and to <i>extirpate Popery</i>?</p>

<div class="sidenote">What Petitions
warrantable
and what
not.</div>

<p><i>True.</i> Such a Petition as you Instance in, is in the appearance
of it, not only <i>Lawfull</i>, but <i>Commendable</i>; But then it must be
promoted by <i>Lawfull means</i>, and under <i>Decent Circumstances</i>.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 28]</span>
'Tis a good thing to <i>Preach</i>, or C<i>atechize</i>, but it is not for a
<i>Lay-man</i> presently to pluck the <i>Parson</i> out of the <i>Desk</i>, or <i>Pulpit</i>,
that he himself may do the Office. It is a Good thing to execute
<i>Justice</i>, but yet <i>a private man</i> must not invade the <i>Judgment-Seat</i>,
though it were to passe even the most <i>Righteous Sentence</i>.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> The King may chuse whether he'l <i>Grant</i> or no; So that
without invading <i>His Right</i> we only claim the <i>Liberty</i> of <i>Presenting</i>
the <i>Request</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">No Petition
to be press'd
after Prohibition.</div>

<p><i>True.</i> That may be well enough at <i>First</i>; but still, after
<i>One Refusal</i>, and That with a <i>Publick Interdict</i> on the Neck
on't, forbidding the pursuance of it; such a <i>Petition</i> is not by
any means to be <i>Repeated</i>. <i>First</i>, out of <i>Respect</i> to <i>Regal Authority</i>:
<i>Secondly</i>, as the <i>King</i> is the <i>Sole Judge</i> of the matter:
<i>Thirdly</i>, upon the <i>Importunity</i>, it is not so properly <i>Desiring</i> of a
thing, as <i>Tugging</i> for it. <i>Fourthly</i>, It tends many ways to the
Diminution of his Majesties <i>Honour</i>, in case it be Obtain'd: For
it implys, either <i>Levity</i>, or <i>Fear</i>; or (to make the best on't)
the <i>King</i> confers the <i>Obligation</i>, and the <i>Heads of the Petition</i> receive
the <i>Thanks</i>. Now adde to all this, the <i>suborning</i> of <i>Subscriptions</i>,
and the <i>Inflaming</i> of <i>Parties</i>, what can be more <i>Undutifull</i>
or <i>Dangerous</i>?</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> But do not you find many <i>Honest</i> and <i>Considerable men</i>
concern'd in these <i>Petitions</i>?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Nation
poyson'd with
False Principles.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Injustice
of our Common
Wealthsmen.</div>

<p><i>True.</i> Yes, in several of them <i>I</i> do; and the main reason is
This. There's no man under <i>Five and Fifty</i>, at Least, that is able
to give any Account, of the <i>Designe</i>, and <i>Effects</i> of this way
of Petitioning in <i>Forty</i> and <i>Forty One</i>, but by <i>Hear-say</i>: so that
This Nation proceeds mostly upon the <i>Maxims</i>, and <i>Politiques</i>,
which That <i>Republican</i> Humour deliver'd over to us: But yet
let the <i>Thing</i>, or the <i>Manner</i> of it be as it will, Those that
<i>disarm'd</i>, and <i>turn'd back</i> the <i>Kentish Petitioners</i> at <i>London-bridg</i>.
Those that <i>Wounded</i>, and <i>Murther'd</i> the <i>Surry-Petitioneres</i> in the
<i>Palace Yard</i>, only for desiring a <i>Peace</i>, and in order to the <i>Preservation</i>
of his <i>late Majesty</i>: <i>Those People</i> methinks, that were so
Outrageous <i>Against Those Petitions</i> (and Several others of the
same kind) should not have the Face now to be so <i>Violent, for
This</i>. And whoever examines the <i>present Roll</i>, will find the <i>Old
Republicans</i> to be the <i>Ring-leaders</i>.</p>

<p>Bum. Really, <i>Citt</i>, the man speaks Reason.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The mean
ways of promoting
their
Designs.</div>

<p><i>True.</i> Consider then the <i>Mean ways</i> ye have of advancing your<span class="pagenum">[Pg 29]</span>
Pretensions, by <i>Falshoods</i>, and <i>Scandals</i>, to disappoint Honest
men of <i>Elections</i>; The use ye make of the most <i>Servile Instruments</i>,
to promote your Ends; your <i>fawning Methods</i> of <i>Popularity</i>
toward the <i>Rabble</i>; your ways of undermining the <i>Government</i>
of the <i>City</i>, as well as of the <i>Nation</i>; your worse then
<i>Jesuitical Evasions</i> in matter of <i>Conscience</i>; your <i>Non-sensical Salvo's</i>,
and <i>Expositions</i> of <i>Christian Liberty</i>; your putting out the
<i>Church of Englands Colours</i>, and calling your selves <i>Protestants</i>,
when you are effectually no better then <i>Algerines</i>, and <i>Pyrating</i>
even upon <i>Christianity it self</i>; your Beating of the wood, in
the History of our most <i>Seditious Times</i>, to start <i>Presidents</i> and
<i>Records</i> in favour of your own Disloyal Purposes. The <i>Pharisaical</i>
Distinguishing of your selves from the <i>Profane</i> (as you
are pleas'd to stile all others,) even in your <i>Dresse, Tone, Language</i>,
&amp;c. Your Uncharitable <i>Bitternesse of Spirit</i>; your <i>lying
in wait</i> for <i>Blood</i>; and laying of <i>Snares</i> for the <i>Unwary</i> and the
<i>Innocent</i>; and still vouching an <i>Inspiration</i> for all your <i>Wickednesse</i>;
your gathering of <i>all Winds</i> toward the raising of a <i>Storm</i>;
Your <i>Unity</i> in <i>Opposition</i>, and in <i>nothing Else</i>: your <i>Clamours</i>,
and <i>Invectives</i> against <i>Priests</i>, and <i>Jesuits</i>, when it is the Church
of <i>England</i> yet, that feels the <i>Last effect</i> of your <i>Sacrilegious Rage</i>.
'Tis not so much the <i>Officers</i> of the Church, and State, that are
<i>Popishly Affected</i>, but the <i>Offices</i> Themselves; and Those in the
first place (as you chuse your <i>Sins</i> too) that are most <i>Beneficiall</i>.
To say nothing of your wild <i>Impostures</i> upon the <i>Multitude</i>.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Now you talk of <i>Impostures</i>, what do you think of
<i>L'Estrange's History of the P L O T</i>, and his <i>Answer to the A P P E A L</i>?
Whether are Those Pamphlets, <i>Impostures</i> upon the
<i>Multitude</i>, or <i>Not</i>?</p>

<p><i>True.</i> You were saying e'en now, That <i>The History of the
Damnable Popish Plot</i> was of your Writing; Answer me That
Question, First; Was it so, or not?</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> No, it was not of my Writing; It was done by a <i>Protestant-Club</i>.</p>

<p><i>True.</i> Why then let me tell ye, if a man may believe the
<i>Preface</i> to That <i>Club-History</i>, or the <i>Notes</i> upon the <i>Answer
to the Appeal</i> (for I have read them all:) <i>L'Estrange's Pamphlets</i>
are great abuses upon the <i>People</i>: But if you had the Books about
ye, the matter were easily clear'd by comparing them.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> By good luck we have 'um all about us, that can any<span class="pagenum">[Pg 30]</span>
way concern this Question. And look ye here now.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reflexions upon
<i>L'Estrange</i>.</div>

<p>First, <i>He calls his</i> Abridgement <i>of the</i> Tryals, <i>The</i> History <i>of
the</i> Plot, <i>without mentioning one word of the Original Contrivance,
the Preparatives, manner of Discovery, and other Remarkables essential
to a</i> History.</p>

<p>2. <i>He omits</i> Staly's <i>and</i> Reading's Tryals, <i>which yet sure had
Relation to the</i> Plot.</p>

<p>3. <i>In his</i> Epistle, <i>he seems to drown the</i> Popish Plot <i>with suggestions
of an</i> Imaginary One <i>of the</i> Protestants.</p>

<p>4. <i>The amusing People with such Stories, is notoriously a Part of
the</i> Grand Popish Designe.</p>

<p>5. <i>Whereas he tells us, that not one</i> Material Point <i>is omitted,
most Readers cannot finde the substantial part of Mr.</i> Bedloes
<i>Evidence against</i> Wakeman, <i>(P. 46 of the Tryall) So much as
hinted at: Not to mention the gross shuffles, and Omissions in</i> Pag. 77,
<i>and elsewhere.</i></p>

<p>6. <i>He charges the</i> Printed Tryals (<i>in his FREEBORN SUBIECT</i>
P. 15.) <i>with many</i> Gross Incoherences, <i>and very</i> Material mistakes;
<i>yet Instances but</i> One, <i>and corrected too, as an</i> Erratum.</p>

<p>7. <i>When Our Posterity shall urge these Tryals for proof against</i> Papists,
<i>how easily may the subtle Villains stop their Mouths, by alledging
from this Authour that</i> no heed is to be given to the said Tryals;
<i>(being so publickly own'd by a Person of his Note, and Late Qualification)
to be guilty of so many, and such very</i> Material Mistakes.</p>
<br>
<div class="sidenote">The Fore going
Reflections
Answer'd.</div>

<p><i>True.</i> Observe here, <i>First L'Estrange</i> expounds his <i>History</i> in
the <i>Title Page</i>, by restraining it to the <i>Charge</i> and <i>Defence</i> of <i>the
Persons there mentioned</i>: Beside that he calls it an <i>Historical Abstract</i>,
and a <i>Summary</i>, in his <i>Epistle</i>.</p>

<p>2. <i>Staleys Trial</i> had no Relation at all to the <i>Plot</i>, and <i>Reading</i>
was not Try'd for's <i>Life</i>; and so not within the Compass of
his intention exprest in the <i>Preface</i>.</p>

<p>3. The <i>Epistle</i> acknowledges a <i>Detestable Plot</i>, and a <i>Conspiracy</i>:
but advises <i>Moderation</i>, and that the <i>Rabble</i> may not dictate
Laws to <i>Authority</i>; for <i>that Licence</i> was the Cause of the
<i>Late Rebellion</i>.</p>

<p>4. It was more then a <i>Story</i>, the <i>Murther</i> of the <i>Late King</i>,
and the <i>Subversion</i> of the Government, and the <i>suppressing</i> of these<span class="pagenum">[Pg 31]</span>
<i>Necessary Hints</i>, and <i>Cautions</i> is notoriously a part of the <i>Grand
Phanatical Design</i>.</p>

<p>5. In <i>L'Estranges History</i> here <i>Pag.</i> 79 and 80. there's every
particular of Mr. <i>Bedloes</i> Evidence in Sir <i>George Wakemans Tryal,
Pag.</i> 46. with many other passages over and above: whereas
your <i>Damnable History</i> here <i>Pag.</i> 295. falls short at least by One
Half. And then for the <i>shuffles</i>, and <i>Omissions</i> reflected upon,
<i>Pag.</i> 77. see <i>L'Estranges Words, Pag.</i> 88. <i>The Lord Chief Justice</i>
(says he) <i>after some Remarkes upon the</i> Romish Principles, <i>summ'd
up the Evidence, and gave Directions to the Jury:</i> which is the substance

it is in plain <i>English, No where</i>.</p>

<p>6. Look ye, here's more Juggling. He says S E V E R A L
<i>Gross Incoherences</i>, and you have made them M A N Y: and
then you have left out the <i>Parenthesis</i>, (<i>especially in the Latter of
them</i>) which varies the Case too. And I remember again,
that the <i>Erratum</i> was supply'd after <i>L'Estrange</i> had <i>corrected</i>
it: And sure it was a Gross one too, to expose a <i>Protestant
Gentleman</i> for a <i>Papist, Nine times</i> in <i>two Pages</i>. I could shew
ye several other <i>Material Mistakes</i>, but One shall serve for
<i>all. Pag.</i> 45. (as I take it) of <i>Irelands Tryal</i>; which you will
finde charg'd upon the Press, in <i>L'Estranges History, Pag.</i> 18.</p>

<p>7. Pray'e mark me now: <i>L'Estrange</i> findes <i>Errours</i> of the
<i>Press</i> in the <i>Other Tryals</i> and <i>Rectifies</i> them, in his <i>Own</i>:
Now if Posterity shall finde in the <i>Right</i>, that the <i>Other</i> are
<i>wrong</i>, they are in no danger of being <i>Misled</i> by the <i>One</i>,
in what is <i>Corrected</i> by the <i>Other</i>: And if they do not read
the <i>Right Copy</i> at all, there's no harm done to the Other,
but they must take it as they finde it. So that this <i>Remark</i>
is so far from <i>Disparaging</i> the <i>Proceedings</i>, that a greater
Right can hardly be done to <i>Publick Justice</i> by a <i>Pamphlet</i>. But
now let the <i>Epistle</i> speak for it <i>self</i>.</p>

<h2>To the READER.</h2>


<div class="sidenote">The Episle to
L'Estrange's
History of
the Plot.</div>


<p>There has not been any point, perhaps, in the whole
Tract of <i>English Story</i>, either so dangerous to be mistaken
in, or so difficult, and yet so necessary to be understood,
as the Mystery of this detestable <i>Plot</i> now in Agitation.
(A Judgement for our Sins, augmented by our Follies,)
But the world is so miserably divided betwixt some that will believe
every thing, and others nothing that not only <i>Truth</i>, but
<i>Christianity</i> it self is almost lost between them; and no place
left for Sobriety and Moderation. We are come to govern our
selves by Dreams and Imaginations; We make every <i>Coffee-house
Tale</i> an Article of our Faith; and from Incredible Fables
we raise Invincible Arguments. A man must be fierce and violent
to get the Reputation of being <i>Well-affected</i>; as if the calling
of one another <i>Damned Heretique</i>, and <i>Popish Dog</i>, were the
whole Sum of the Controversie. And what's all this, but the effect
of a Popular Licence and Appeal? When every Mercenary
Scribler shall take upon him to handle matters of Faith, and
State; give Laws to Princes; and every Mechanique sit Judge
upon the Government! Were not these the very Circumstances
of the late <i>Times</i>? When the Religious Jugglers from all
Quarters fell in with the Rabble, and managed them, as it
were, by a certain sleight of hand: The <i>Rods</i> were turned into
<i>Serpents</i> on both sides, and the Multitude not able to say, which
was <i>Aaron</i>, and which the <i>Enchanter</i>. Let us have a Care of
the same Incantation over again, Are we not under the protection
of a Lawfull Authority? Nor was there ever any thing
more narrowly Sifted, or more vigorously discouraged,
then this <i>Conspiracy</i>. <i>Reformation</i> is the proper business of
<i>Government</i> and <i>Council</i>, but when it comes to work once
at the wrong End, there is nothing to be expected from it,
but <i>Tumult</i> and <i>Convulsion</i>. A Legal and Effectual provision against
the Danger of <i>Romish Practices</i> and <i>Errours</i>, will never
serve Their Turn, whose Quarrel is barely to the <i>Name</i> of
<i>Popery</i>, without understanding the Thing it self. And if there
were not a <i>Roman Catholick</i> left in the three Kingdoms, they
would be never the better satisfied, for where they cannot
find Popery, they will make it: nay and be troubled too that<span class="pagenum">[Pg 33]</span>
they could not <i>find</i> it. It is no new thing for a Popular Outcry,
in the matter of <i>Religion</i>, to have a <i>State-Faction</i> in the
belly of it. The first late Clamour was against <i>Downright Popery</i>;
and then came on <i>Popishly Affected</i>; (<i>That</i> sweeps all.)
The <i>Order of Bishops</i>, <i>and the Discipline of the Church</i> took their
Turns next; and the next blow was at the <i>Crown</i> it self;
when every Man was made a <i>Papist</i> that would not play
the Knave and the Fool, for Company, with the Common
People.</p>

<p>These things duly weighed, and considering the Ground
of our present Distempers; the Compiler of this Abridgment
reckoned that he could not do his Countrymen a better Office,
than (by laying before them the naked state of things) to
give them at one view, a Prospect, both of the subject matter
of their Apprehensions, and of the Vigilance, Zeal, and
needful severity of the Government on their behalf. To which
end, he hath here drawn up an <i>Historical Abstract</i> of the whole
matter of Fact concerning those Persons who have hitherto
been Tryed for their Lives, either upon the <i>Plot</i> it self, or in
Relation to it: opposing Authentick Records to wandring
Rumours; and delivering the <i>Truth</i> in all Simplicity. He
hath not omitted any one material Point: There is not so
much as one <i>Partial Stroke</i> in it; not a flourish, nor any thing
but a bare and plain <i>Collection</i>, without any Tincture either
of Credulity, or Passion. And it is brought into so narrow
a Compass too, that it will ease the Readers <i>head</i>, as well
as his <i>purse</i>; by clearing him of the puzzle of <i>Forms</i>, and <i>Interlocutories</i>.
that serve only to amuse and mislead a man, by
breaking the Order, and confounding the Relative parts of the
<i>Proceeding</i>.</p>

<p>Having this in Contemplation; and being at the same time
possest of a most exact <i>Summary</i> of all passages here in Question;
This Reporter was only to cast an Extract of these Notes
into a Method: especially finding, that upon comparing the
substance of his own papers, with the most warrantable Prints
that have been published; his own <i>Abstract</i> proved to be not
only every jot as Correct, but much more Intelligible, which
being <i>short</i> and <i>full</i>; he thought might be useful, and find Credit
in the world upon its own account, without need of a
<i>Voucher</i>.</p>

<p><i>True.</i> You have now the whole matter before you; the <i>Epistle</i>,
ye see, justifies it self: And then for the <i>Narrative</i>, I dare
undertake he shall yield up the Cause, if you can but produce
any <i>One Material Point</i>, which he hath either <i>Falsify'd</i>, <i>Palliated</i>, or
<i>Omitted</i>, in the whole <i>Proceeding</i>. But to be plain with you, <i>Citt</i>,
One of the <i>Authours</i> of <i>your Preface</i> is a <i>Common setter</i>, <i>a Forger of
Hands</i>, <i>a little spy</i> upon the <i>Swan</i> in <i>Fishstreet</i>; a <i>Hackny Sollicitor</i>
against both <i>Church</i> and <i>State</i>: You know this to be true <i>Citt</i>;
and that I do not speak upon Guess; so that <i>Calumny</i>, and <i>False
Witnessing</i> is the best part of that <i>Authours Trade</i>. And then the
<i>pretended History</i> is a direct <i>Arraignment</i> of the <i>Government</i>. He
takes up the <i>King</i> and <i>Council</i>, <i>Pag.</i> 381. reflects upon the <i>Judges</i>
in the very <i>Contents</i>, and elsewhere; he descants upon the <i>Duke
of York</i> in opposition to the express sense and declaration of the
<i>Bench</i>, <i>Pag.</i> 145. and has the confidence yet to Dedicate this
<i>Gally-mawfry</i> of audacious <i>slanders</i> to <i>the Two Houses of Parliament</i>.
There is little more in the whole, then what has been
eaten and spew'd up again Thirty times over: and the intire
work is only a <i>Medly</i> of <i>Rags</i>, and <i>Solacisms</i>, pick'd up out of
<i>Rubbish</i>, and most suitably put together.</p>
<br>
<p><i>Citt.</i> You may take his part as ye please, But there's a Famous
<i>Lecturer</i> charg'd him Publiquely for <i>Popery</i>, in his <i>Answer</i> to the
<i>Appeal</i>; and for falling upon Dr. <i>Lloyd</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
<i>L'Estrange</i>
charg'd as a
Papist, by a
Certain Lecturer.</div>

<p><i>True.</i> He did so; but at the same time that <i>Lecturer</i> found no
fault with the <i>Appeal it self</i>; and the best on't is, his <i>Tongue's</i> no
more a slander then his <i>Pen</i>: And whoever reads what he has
written concerning the <i>Late King</i>, and the <i>Episcopal Church</i>,
will think never the worse of <i>L'Estrange</i> for what he says. Now
for the <i>Reverend Dean of Bangor</i>, I dare say he never <i>spake</i>, or
<i>thought</i> of him, but with <i>Veneration</i>. Let me see the book.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Ground
of his Accusation.</div>

<p>Look, ye here, 'tis <i>pag.</i> 18. in <i>L'Estrange's Impression</i>, and 'tis
<i>pag.</i> 15. in <i>this</i>; and here's the Point [<i>Their Loyalty and Good
service paid to the King</i> (says the <i>Appealer</i> speaking of the Papists)
<i>was meerly in their own Defence</i>.] Now see <i>L'Estrange's Reply</i> upon
it, <i>If it lies</i> (says he) <i>as a</i> Reproach <i>upon them that they did
then not serve the King out of</i> Loyalty; <i>that which they</i> did, <i>was yet better
then</i> not serving <i>him</i> at all; <i>and better in a Higher degree</i> still, <i>then</i>
Fighting against <i>him</i>. And a little after. <i>It is worth the Observation,
that not a man drew his Sword in the opposite Cause who was
not a</i> Known Separatist; <i>and that on the Other side, not one</i> Schismatick<span class="pagenum">[Pg 35]</span>
<i>ever struck stroke in the</i> Kings Quarrell.</p>

<p>And now for your Notes upon his Answer, they are so silly, that
it were Ridiculous to Reply upon 'um [<i>who knows</i> (says he) <i>but
the Regicides were Papists in disguise</i>, <i>pag.</i> 19.] And a deal of such
senselesse stuff; enough to turn a bodies Stomach. And if you'd
inform your self of his Malice; look ye here <i>pag.</i> 4. <i>p.</i> 9. and
<i>p.</i> 33 how he Palliates, if not Justifies, the Late Rebellion, the
Murther of the Arch-Bishop of St. <i>Andrews</i>, and the drawing
of the Sword against the King.</p>

<p>Briefly, 'tis an <i>Insipid Bawling</i> piece of <i>Foolery</i>, from One end
to the Other. And it is not but that I highly approve of your
<i>Zeal</i> for the Discovery of the <i>Plot</i>, and Suppressing of <i>Popery</i>,
but we are not yet to Trample upon <i>Laws</i>, and <i>Publique Orders</i>,
for the attaining even of those Glorious ends.</p>

<p>But now I think on't; deal freely with me; did you really go
to the <i>Registers</i> ye spake of, to furnish <i>Names</i> for your <i>Subscriptions</i>?</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> No; That was but a <i>Flourish</i>: but all the Rest we <i>Literally</i>
did.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A gross
Cheat upon
the Nation.</div>

<p><i>True.</i> Are not you Conscious to your selves of your Iniquities?
who made <i>You</i> a <i>Commissioner</i> for the <i>Town</i>, or <i>You</i> for the
<i>Country</i>? But we are like to have a fine business of it, when the
<i>Dreggs</i> of the <i>People</i> set up for the <i>Representatives</i> of the <i>Nation</i>;
to the Dishonour of the most <i>Considerable</i>, and Sober part of the
<i>Kingdome</i>. Pre'thee <i>Bumpkin</i>, with thy <i>Poles</i>, and <i>Baltiques</i>,
how shouldst thou come to understand the <i>Ballance</i> of <i>Empires</i>?
who are <i>Delinquents</i>, and who <i>not</i>? the Right of <i>Bishops Votes</i>?
And <i>You</i> (forsooth) are to Teach the <i>King</i> when to call a <i>Parliament</i>,
and when to let it alone. And are not you a fine Fool
i'the mean time, to Drudg for the Faction that Sets ye on, to be
afterwards made a slave for your pains?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lewd Practises
of the
Faction.</div>

<p>And then for You, <i>Citt</i>, with your <i>Mouldy Records</i>, your
<i>Coordinate Estates</i>, and your <i>Sovereign Power of the People</i>. Do
not I know all your Fallacies, your Shifts, and Hiding-holes?
There's not one step you set, but I can trace you in't: You have
your <i>Spies</i> upon all <i>Libraries</i>, as well as <i>Conversations</i>; your <i>Agents</i>
for the procuring of old <i>Manuscripts</i>, and <i>Records</i>, and for
the <i>Falsifying</i> of <i>New ones</i>, to make them look like <i>Old Ones</i>.
Nay, the <i>Papers</i> of <i>State</i> themselves had much ado to scape ye.
Those that assert the <i>Just Rights</i> of the <i>Crown</i>, you either <i>Bury</i> or<span class="pagenum">[Pg 36]</span>
<i>Conceal</i>; only Publishing the <i>Presidents</i> of <i>Seditious Times</i>, in
Vindication of such Principles.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> I must confess I take the <i>Government</i> to be <i>Coordinate</i>,
and the <i>King One</i> of the <i>Three Estates</i>, with submission to be better
inform'd.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Against Coordination.</div>

<p><i>True.</i> If it be so, how comes it that the House of <i>Commons</i>
even in their most Popular seasons, have still own'd the Crown
of <i>England</i> to be <i>Imperial</i>? How comes it that all our <i>Laws</i> are
call'd the <i>Kings Laws</i>: all our <i>Courts of Justice</i> his <i>Majesties
Courts</i>, and all <i>Publick Causes</i> try'd in the <i>Kings Name</i>, and by
the <i>Authority</i> of his <i>Majesty</i>?</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> But have not the <i>Two Houses</i> their share in the <i>Legislative
Power</i>?</p>

<div class="sidenote">It is the sanction
makes the Law, not
the Consent.</div>

<p><i>True.</i> You must distinguish betwixt the <i>Consent</i>, and the <i>Sanction</i>;
the <i>Preparatory</i> Part is <i>Their's</i>, the <i>Stamp</i> is the <i>Kings</i>: The
Two <i>Houses</i> Consent to a <i>Bill</i>; It is only a <i>Bill</i>, when it is <i>presented</i>,
and it remains yet a <i>Bill</i>, even when the King has <i>Consented</i> to
it; and in this <i>Common Consent</i>, in Order to a <i>Law</i>, the <i>Two Houses</i>
may be said to <i>share</i> with his <i>Majesty</i>: But then the <i>Fiat</i>, that
superinduces an <i>Authority</i>, and is <i>Only</i>, and <i>Properly</i> the Act of
<i>Legislation</i>, is <i>singly</i> in the <i>King</i>. So that though they <i>share</i> in
the <i>Consent</i>, they have no pretence at all to the <i>Sanction</i>: which
is an Act of <i>Authority</i>; the other but of <i>Agreement</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Inconveniences of
a Coordination supposed.</div>

<p>And yet again, admitting your <i>Coordination</i>; First, every
King runs the hazzard of his Crown upon every Parliament he
calls: For <i>That Third Estate</i> lies at the Mercy of the <i>Other Two</i>:
And further, 'tis a kinde of Ringing the Changes with the Government,
the <i>King</i> and <i>Lords</i> shall be Uppermost <i>One day</i>, the
<i>King</i> and <i>Commons</i>, <i>Another</i>, and the <i>Lords</i> and <i>Commons</i>, the
<i>Third</i>: For in this Scale of Constitution whatsoever the <i>One</i>
will <i>not</i>, the <i>Other Two</i>, <i>may</i>.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Well, but Ours is a MIXT Government, and we
are a <i>Free People</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Of a mixt
Government
and a Qualified.</div>

<p><i>True.</i> If ours be a <i>Mixt Government</i>, so as to any <i>Popular Participation</i>
of <i>Power</i> with the <i>King</i>, then it is not a <i>Monarchy</i>: (which
is the <i>Government Only</i> of <i>One</i>) but if you'l call it a <i>Qualifi'd
Government</i>; so as to distinguish it from an <i>Absolute</i> and <i>Unlimited
Government</i>, I'le agree with you. But let the <i>Government</i> be <i>what</i>
it will, and <i>where</i> it will, let it do <i>Right</i> or <i>Wrong</i>, it is <i>Equally
Unaccountable</i>, for there lies no <i>Appeal</i>, but to a <i>Superiour</i>, and the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 37]</span>
<i>Supreme</i> has <i>none</i> but <i>God Himself</i>.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> But if we be a <i>Free People</i>, have not <i>We</i> as much <i>Right</i> to
<i>Our Liberties</i>, as the <i>King</i> has to <i>his Crown</i>?</p>

<p><i>True.</i> Yes, we have, but the King has this Advantage of us,
that <i>We</i> may <i>Forfeit</i> our <i>Liberties</i> but <i>He</i> cannot forfeit his <i>Crown</i>.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> What if a <i>King</i> will Transgresse all the Laws of <i>God</i>
and <i>Man</i>? may not the <i>People</i> resume their <i>Trust</i>?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Power is
from God,
not from the
People.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Soveraignty
of the People
most ridiculous.</div>

<p><i>True.</i> No, not unlesse you can produce an expresse <i>stipulation</i>
to <i>That very purpose</i>. But let me shew you, First, the Errour of
taking That to be a <i>Trust</i> from the <i>People</i>, which, in truth, is an
<i>Ordinance</i> of <i>Providence</i>, For <i>All Power is from God</i>; And Secondly,
the <i>Absurdity</i> of the very <i>Supposition</i>, even in the Case
of a Trust conferr'd by the People. If the <i>King breaks</i> his <i>Trust</i>,
the <i>People Resume</i> it: but <i>who</i> are These <i>People</i>? If a <i>Representative</i>,
they are but <i>Trustees Themselves</i>, and may incur a <i>Forfeiture</i>
too, by the same Argument. Where are we next then? For
if it devolves to the <i>Loose Multitude</i> of <i>Individuals</i>, (which you
will have to be the Fountain of <i>Power</i>) you are Then in an <i>Anarchy</i>,
without any Government at all; and There you must
either Continue in a <i>Dissociated State</i>, or else agree upon <i>Uniting</i>
into some Form of <i>Regiment</i>, or other: and whether it be
<i>Monarchy</i>, <i>Aristocracy</i>, or <i>Democracy</i>, it comes all to a Point. If
you make the <i>Government Accountable</i> upon every Humour of
the <i>People</i>, it lapses again into a <i>Confusion</i>. To say nothing of
the ridiculous phansy of a <i>Sovereignty</i> in the <i>People</i> upon This
Account; that they can never be so brought together either to
<i>Establish</i> or to <i>Dissolve</i> a <i>Government</i>, as to authorize it to be the
<i>Peoples Act</i>. For there must be, <i>First</i>, an <i>Agreement</i> to <i>Meet</i> and
<i>Consult</i>. <i>Secondly</i>, an <i>Agreement</i> upon the <i>Result</i> of That <i>Debate</i>;
and any <i>One Dissenter</i> spoils all, where every <i>Individuall</i>
has an <i>Equall Right</i>: So that unlesse the People be all of the
same minde, This Supposition will be found wholly Impractible
and Idle.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> But is there no Fence then against <i>Tyranny</i>?</p>

<p><i>True.</i> Only <i>Patience</i>, unless you run into <i>Anarchy</i>, and then
into that which you call <i>Tyranny</i> again; and so tread Eternally
that Circle of <i>Rigour</i> and <i>Confusion</i>. <i>In fine</i>, the Question is this,
whether people had better run <i>Certainly</i> into <i>Confusion</i> to avoid
a <i>Possible Tyranny</i>, or venture a <i>Possible Tyranny</i>, to avoid a <i>Certain
Confusion</i>.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> But where we finde <i>Positive Law</i> and <i>Provisions</i> to <i>fail</i><span class="pagenum">[Pg 38]</span>
us, may we not in those Cases, betake our selves to the <i>Laws</i> of
<i>Nature</i> and <i>Self-Preservation</i>?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Self-preservation
is no
Plea for the
People.</div>

<p><i>True.</i> No, ye may not; for many Reasons. First, it makes
you <i>Judges</i>; not only <i>when</i> those Laws take Place, but also <i>what</i>
they <i>are</i>. Secondly, the <i>Government</i> is <i>Dissolved</i>, if Subjects may
go off or on at pleasure. Thirdly, <i>Self-Preservation</i> is the Plea only
of <i>Individuals</i>; and there can be no Colour for the exposing of
the <i>Publick</i> in favour of <i>Particulars</i>. What would ye think of a
<i>Common Seaman</i> that in a <i>Storm</i> should throw the <i>Steers-man Overboard</i>,
and set himself at the <i>Helm</i>? Or of a <i>Souldier</i> that shou'd
refuse a <i>Dangerous Post</i> for fear of being knock'd on the Head,
when the <i>whole Army</i>, depends upon the Maintaining of <i>That Pass</i>.</p>

<p><i>Citt.</i> Pray'e tell me what it is that you call <i>Government</i>, and
how far it <i>extends</i>? for you were saying even now, that the <i>Reason</i>
of <i>all Governments</i> is <i>alike</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What Government
is.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Certain Priviledges
essential
to
Government.</div>

<p><i>True.</i> <i>Government is the</i> Will, <i>and</i> Power <i>of a</i> Multitude, <i>United
in some One Person, or More, for the Good, and safety of the whole.</i>
You must not take it that <i>all Governments</i> are <i>alike</i>; but the <i>Ratio</i>
of <i>all Governments</i> is the <i>same</i> in some Cases. As in the Instance
of <i>Self-Preservation</i>; which is only Pleadable by the <i>Supream Magistrate</i>,
in Bar to all <i>General Exceptions</i>; for he is First, presumed
in Reason, to be vested with all <i>Powers necessary</i> for the
<i>Defence</i>, and <i>Protection</i> of the <i>Community</i>: without which his
Authority is Vain. He is Secondly, Oblig'd in <i>Duty</i> to exert
those <i>Powers</i> for the <i>Common Good</i>: and he is Thirdly, entrusted
with the Judgment of all <i>Exigences</i> of <i>State</i>, be they <i>Greater</i> or
<i>Lesse</i>; wherein the Publick Good may be concern'd. Now put
the Case that a Magistrate should make a wrong <i>Judgment</i> of
Matters, and misemploy those <i>Powers</i>; it were an Infelicity in
the <i>Administration</i>; but the <i>Sacredness</i> of <i>Authority</i> is still the
same: And he is a Mad man, that plucks down his <i>House</i>, because
it rains in at the <i>Window</i>. And in case of the <i>Magistrate</i>,
it is not so much <i>He</i>, as <i>They</i>; for the <i>King</i> is (as I said before)
the <i>United Power</i> and <i>Will</i> of the <i>People</i>. And so Fare ye well.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
